different elements of the Message Queue service.
<a href="client-programming-model.html#aerbg">Client Programming Model</a>
described the programming model and how clients use the Java and C APIs
to interact with the Message Queue client runtime, the part of the
message service that is directly accessed by client applications. This
chapter focuses on the broker services, the part of the message service
that is accessed through administration tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The broker is the centerpiece of the Message Queue service shown in
<a href="messaging-systems-introduction.html#gbpdm">Figure 1-6</a>. The broker
provides the set of services that enable secure, reliable messaging:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connection services that manage the physical connections between a
broker and its clients that provide transport for incoming and outgoing
messages. See <a href="#aerci">Connection Services</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message delivery services that route and deliver JMS messages as well
as control messages used by the message service to support reliable
delivery. See <a href="#aercl">Message Delivery Services</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistence services that manage the writing of data to persistent
storage and its retrieval from persistent storage. See
<a href="#aercs">Persistence Services</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security services that authenticate users connecting to the broker and
authorize their actions. See <a href="#aercv">Security Services</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clustering services that support the grouping of brokers into a
cluster to achieve scalability and availability. See
<a href="broker-clusters.html#aerdj">Broker Clusters</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring services that generate metrics and diagnostic information
and write this information to a specified output channel. See
<a href="#aercy">Monitoring Services</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sections that follow describe each of the broker services. These
services are configured by setting broker configuration properties.
Broker properties are specified in different configuration files and can
also be set using options of the broker startup command.
"<a href="../mq-admin-guide/broker-configuration.html#GMADG00035">Configuring a Broker</a>" in Open Message Queue
Administration Guide describes the broker configuration files and
explains the order of precedence by which property values in one
configuration file can be used to override values set in a different
file. Properties set with the startup command override all other

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_connection_services">Connection Services</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You use connection-related properties to configure and manage the
physical connections between a broker and its clients. As shown in
<a href="messaging-systems-introduction.html#gbpdm">Figure 1-6</a> both
application clients and administration clients can connect to the
broker. The JMS specification does not dictate that providers implement
any specific wire protocols. Message Queue connection services, used by
application clients and administration clients to connect to the broker,
are currently layered on top of TCP, TLS, HTTP, or HTTPS protocols. TLS
(Transport Layer Security) is a successor to and compatible with SSL
(Secure Socket Layer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two general types of connection services:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>NORMAL</code>: Services that provide JMS support and allow clients to
connect to the broker (<code>jms</code>, <code>ssljms</code>, <code>http</code>, or <code>https</code>) and are
layered on top of <code>TCP</code>, <code>TLS</code>, <code>HTTP</code>, or <code>HTTPS</code> protocols,
respectively. (Services layered on top of HTTP allow messages to pass
through firewalls.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ADMIN</code>: Services that allow administrators to connect to the broker (
<code>admin</code>, <code>ssladmin</code>) and are layered on top of <code>TCP</code> or <code>TLS</code> protocols.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connection services are available through dedicated ports that can be
dynamically assigned by the broker&#8217;s Port Mapper (see <a href="#aercj">Port
Mapper Service</a>) or statically assigned by the administrator. By
default, when you start the broker, the <code>jms</code> and <code>admin</code> services are
up and running. Additionally, you can configure a broker to run any or
all of the connection services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each connection service is multi-threaded, supporting multiple
connections, and each service supports specific authentication and
authorization (access control) features. See <a href="#aercv">Security
Services</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should a connection fail, the Message Queue service can automatically
retry connecting the client to the same broker or to a different broker
if this feature is enabled. For more information, see the description of
the automatic reconnect feature in
<a href="mq-optional-jms-support.html#aerdz">Message Queue Features</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The connections provided by Message Queue connection services can be
configured to specify which brokers to connect to, how to handle
reconnection, message flow control, and so on. For additional
information about how connections can be configured, see
<a href="client-programming-model.html#aerbn">Connection</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connection configuration can be performed by both administrators and in
client application code:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An administrator creates connection factory administered objects that
encapsulate connection behaviors. In addition, an administrator can use
broker properties to activate non-default connection services, to assign
static ports if required, to configure threading, and to specify a host
to connect to if multiple network interfaces are used. An administrator
can also specify a ping interval to test whether the client is
accessible; this is useful in managing resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client code can instantiate configuration factory objects and set
their attributes to achieve desired connection behaviors. These
attributes specify non-default connection services, hosts, ports, a list
of brokers to connect to in case reconnection is required, and
reconnection behavior. The client can also specify a ping interval to
test for failed connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A client can connect to the Message Queue service through a firewall.
This can be done either by having the firewall administrator open a
specific port and then connecting to that (static) port or by using the
HTTP or HTTPS service as summarized in
<a href="mq-optional-jms-support.html#aerdz">Message Queue Features</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_port_mapper_service">Port Mapper Service</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connection services are dynamically assigned a port by a common Port
Mapper service that resides at a the broker&#8217;s main port, 7676. When the
Message Queue client runtime sets up a connection with the broker, it
first contacts the Port Mapper, requesting a port number for the
connection service it has chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can override the Port Mapper by assigning a static port number for
the <code>jms</code>, <code>ssljms</code>, <code>admin</code> and <code>ssladmin</code> connection services when
configuring these services. However, static ports are generally used
only in special situations, such as in making connections through a
firewall, and are not generally recommended.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_thread_pool_management">Thread Pool Management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each connection service is multithreaded, supporting multiple
connections. The threads needed for these connections are maintained by
the broker in a pool. How they are allocated depends on the values you
specify for the minimum and maximum thread values, and on the threading
model you choose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can set broker properties to specify a minimum number and maximum
number of threads. As threads are needed by connections, they are added
to the thread pool for the service supporting that connection. The
minimum specifies the number of threads available to be allocated. When
the available threads exceeds this minimum threshold, the system will
shut down threads as they become free until the minimum is reached
again, thereby saving on memory resources. Under heavy loads, the number
of threads might increase until the pool&#8217;s maximum number is reached; at
this point, new connections are rejected until a thread becomes
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The threading model you choose specifies whether threads are dedicated
to a single connection or shared by multiple connections:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the dedicated model, each connection to the broker requires two
threads: one for incoming messages and one for outgoing messages. This
limits the number of possible connections but provides high performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the shared model, connections are processed by a shared thread when
sending or receiving messages. Because each connection does not require
dedicated threads, this model increases the number of possible
connections, but adds some overhead for thread management and thereby
impacts performance.</p>

<p>Once clients are connected to the broker, the routing and delivery of
messages can proceed. In this phase, the broker is responsible for
creating and managing different types of physical destinations, for
ensuring a smooth flow of messages, and for using resources efficiently.
The broker properties related to routing and delivery are used by the
broker to manage these tasks in a way that suits your application&#8217;s
needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_physical_destinations">Physical Destinations</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A physical destination on the broker is a memory location where messages
are stored before being delivered to a message consumer. There are four
kinds of physical destinations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Admin-created destinations are created by an administrator using
Message Queue administration tools. Admin-created destinations
correspond to destination administered objects created by an
administrator and accessed by client applications by using a JNDI
lookup. Admin-created destinations can also correspond to destination
objects created programmatically by a client application. You use
Message Queue administration tools to set or update properties for each
admin-created destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-created destinations are automatically created by the broker
whenever a message consumer or producer attempts to access a nonexistent
destination. These are typically used during development. You can set a
broker property to disallow the creation of such destinations. You set
broker properties to configure all auto-create destinations on a
particular broker.<br>
An auto-created destination is automatically destroyed by the broker
when it is no longer being used: that is, when it has no consumer
clients and no longer contains any messages. If a broker restarts, it
only recreates this kind of destination if it contains persistent
messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temporary destinations are explicitly created and destroyed
programmatically by client applications that need a destination at which
to receive replies to messages. As their name implies, these
destinations are temporary. They are maintained by the broker only for
the duration of the connection in which they are created.<br>
Temporary destinations are only stored persistently only if the consumer
of the destination is set to automatically reconnect in the event of
failure. Otherwise, they are not recreated when a broker is restarted.
Nevertheless, temporary destinations are visible to administration
tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dead message queue is a specialized destination, created
automatically at broker startup and used to store dead messages for
diagnostic purposes. You can set properties for the dead message queue
using the <code>imqcmd</code> utility.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Managing Destinations</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Managing a destination involves one or more of the following tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating, pausing, resuming, or destroying a destination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listing all destinations on a broker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Displaying information about the state and properties of a destination</p>

<p>Compacting disk space used to persist messages for a destination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating a physical destination&#8217;s properties</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Management tasks vary with the kind of destination being managed:
admin-created, auto-created, temporary, or dead message queue. For
example, temporary destinations do not need to be explicitly destroyed;
auto created properties are configured using broker configuration
properties which apply to all auto-created destinations on that broker.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuring Physical Destinations</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For optimal performance, you can set properties when creating or
updating physical destinations. Properties that can be set include the
following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The type and name of the destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual and aggregate limits for destinations (the maximum number
of messages, the maximum number of total bytes, the maximum number of
bytes per message, the maximum number of producers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the broker should do when individual or aggregate limits are
exceeded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of messages to be delivered in a single batch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether deleted messages for a destination should be sent to the dead
message queue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of a broker cluster, whether a destination should be
propagated to other brokers in the cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a queue destination you can also configure the maximum number of
active and back up consumers and you can specify (for broker clusters)
whether delivery to a local queue is preferred.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also configure the limits and behavior of the dead message
queue. Note, however, that default properties for this queue differ from
those of a standard queue.</p>

<h5 id="_managing_memory">Managing Memory</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Destinations can consume significant resources, depending on the number
and size of messages they handle and on the number and durability of the
consumers that register; therefore, they need to be managed closely to
guarantee good messaging service performance and reliability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can set properties to prevent a broker from being overwhelmed by
incoming messages and to prevent the broker from running out of memory.
The broker uses three levels of memory protection to keep the message
service operating as resources become scarce: destination limits,
system-wide limits, and system memory thresholds. Ideally, if
destination limits and system-wide limits are set appropriately,
critical system-memory thresholds should never be breached.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Destination Message Limits</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can set destination properties to manage memory and message flow for
each destination. For example, you can specify the maximum number of
producers allowed for a destination, the maximum number (or size) of
messages allowed in a destination, and the maximum size of any single
message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also specify how the broker should respond when any such limits
are reached: to slow producers, to throw out the oldest messages, to
throw out the lowest-priority messages, or to reject the newest
messages.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>System-Wide Message Limits</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use properties to set limits that apply to all destinations
on a broker: you can specify the total number of messages and the memory
consumed by all messages. If any of the system-wide message limits are
reached, the broker rejects new messages.</p>

<p>System Memory Thresholds</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you can use properties to set thresholds at which the broker
takes increasingly serious action to prevent memory overload. The action
taken depends on the state of memory resources: <code>green</code> (plenty of
memory is available), <code>yellow</code> (broker memory is running low), <code>orange</code>
(broker is low on memory), <code>red</code> (broker is out of memory). As the
broker&#8217;s memory state progresses from <code>green</code> to <code>red</code>, the broker takes
increasingly serious actions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It throws out in-memory copies of persistent messages in the data
store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It throttles back producers of non-persistent messages, eventually
stopping the flow of messages into the broker. Persistent message flow
is automatically limited by the requirement that each message be
acknowledged by the broker.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a broker to recover in case of failure, it needs to recreate the
state of its message delivery operations. To be able to do this, it must
save state information to a data store. When the broker restarts, it
uses the saved data to recreate destinations and durable subscriptions,
to recover persistent messages, to roll back open transactions, and to
recreate its routing table for undelivered messages. It can then resume
message delivery.</p>
</div>

also set properties in the broker instance configuration file to enable
the broker to query the LDAP server for information about users and
groups.<br>
The LDAP option is better if scalability is important or if you need the
repository to be shared by different brokers. This might be the case if
you are using broker clusters.</p>

<p>When a client requests a connection, the client must supply a user name
and password. The broker compares the specified name and password to
those stored in the user repository. On transmitting the password from
client to broker, the passwords are encoded using either base 64
encoding or message digest (MD5) hashing. MD5 is used for a flat file
repository; base 64 is required for LDAP repositories. If using LDAP you
may want to use the secure TLS protocol. You can set broker properties
to configure the type of encoding used by each connection service
separately or to set the encoding on a broker-wide basis.</p>

<h5 id="_jaas_based_authentication">JAAS-Based Authentication</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the file-based and LDAP-based built-in authentication
mechanisms, Message Queue also supports the Java Authentication and
Authorization Service (JAAS), which allows you to plug a variety of
services into the broker to authenticate Message Queue clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JAAS defines an abstraction layer between an application and an
authentication mechanism, allowing the desired mechanism to be plugged
in with no disruption or change to application code. For the Message
Queue service, the abstraction layer lies between the broker and the
authentication provider. By setting a few broker properties, it is
possible to plug in any JAAS-compliant authentication service and to
upgrade or change this service with no disruption or change to broker
code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service to be plugged in consists of a LoginModule and of logic that
performs the authentication. A JAAS configuration file contains the
location of the LoginModule. When the broker starts up it locates this
file and uses information in the file to determine which LoginModules it
will use to perform the authentication. The fact that the broker plugs
in an authentication service is transparent to the client; the client
continues to pass authentication information to the broker as before and
gains access to broker services if the identifying information (user
name, password) is authenticated by the plugged in service.</p>

<h4 id="_bridge_services">Bridge Services</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) systems use a broad spectrum of
technologies and standards to provide messaging services. Often, these
technologies and standards are incompatible, leading to MOM systems that
cannot communicate with each other in a larger enterprise application
context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To alleviate this inability to communicate, Message Queue incorporates
bridge services, which are overseen by the Bridge Service Manager, an
application that runs in same JVM as a broker. The Bridge Service
Manager supports individual bridge services of various types. Each type
of bridge service provides connectivity at the broker level to a MOM
technology or standard that would otherwise be unavailable in Message
Queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At present, Message Queue provides two bridge services, the JMS bridge
service and the STOMP bridge service.</p>

<h5 id="_jms_bridge_service">JMS Bridge Service</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the JMS specification does not dictate the communication
protocol between brokers and clients, each JMS provider (including
Message Queue) has defined and uses its own propriety protocol. This
situation has led to non-interoperability across JMS providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JMS bridge service in Message Queue closes this gap by enabling a
Message Queue broker to map its destinations to destinations in external
JMS providers. This mapping effectively allows the Message Queue broker
to communicate with clients of the external JMS provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JMS bridge service supports mapping destinations to external JMS
providers that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are JMS 2.0 compliant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support JNDI administrative objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use connection factories of type <code>javax.jms.ConnectionFactory</code> or

<li>
<p>Support the XA interfaces as a resource manager for transacted mapping</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an administrative and management convenience, the JMS bridge service
supports the creation of any number of JMS bridges in a broker. Each JMS
bridge in the broker is identified by a unique name, has its own
configuration, and is managed separately from other JMS bridges in the
broker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A JMS bridge consists of two primary components:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>One or more links, each of which maps between a destination in the
Message Queue broker and a destination in an external JMS provider or in
another Message Queue broker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A default Dead Message Queue (DMQ) where undeliverable messages are
sent. Additional, special-purpose DMQs can also be specified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To provide destination mapping, each link consists of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A source: the destination from which the JMS bridge receives messages.
The source consists of a connection factory for creating connections to
a JMS provider and a destination in that provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A target: the destination to which the JMS bridge forwards messages
received from the source. The target consists of a connection factory
for creating connections to a JMS provider and a destination in that
provider. Additionally, a target can optionally specify a message
transformer that alters messages from the source before forwarding them
to the target destination.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Links are unidirectional. Links that have an external JMS provider or
another Message Queue broker as their source are called inbound links,
and links that have the Message Queue broker as their source are called
outbound links.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To provide flexible, high-performing message transfer between mapped
destinations, a JMS bridge offers these features:</p>
</div>

<p>Message Queue supports the Sun Java Enterprise System (Java ES)
Monitoring Framework, which allows Java Enterprise System components to
be monitored using a common graphical interface. This interface is
implemented by a web-based console called the Sun Java System Monitoring
Console. If you are running Message Queue along with other Java ES
components, you might find it more convenient to use a single interface
to manage all these components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java ES monitoring framework defines a common data model (CMM) to be
used by all Java ES component products. This model enables a centralized
and uniform view of all Java ES components. Message Queue exposes the
following objects to the Java ES monitoring framework:</p>

administrators can use the console to view performance statistics,
create rules to monitor automatically, and acknowledge alarms. For
detailed information about the mapping of Message Queue objects to CMM
objects, see the Sun Java Enterprise System Monitoring Guide.</p>
</div>

<p>To serve customers who need a standard programmatic means to monitor and
access the broker, Message Queue also supports the Java Management
Extensions (JMX) architecture, which allows a Java application to manage
broker resources programmatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resources include everything that you can manipulate using the Command

<li>
<p>Management includes the ability to dynamically configure and monitor
resources, and the ability to obtain notifications about state changes
and error conditions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JMX specification defines an architecture for the instrumentation
and programmatic management of distributed resources. This architecture
is based on the notion of a managed bean, or MBean: a Java object,
similar to a JavaBean, representing a resource to be managed. Message
Queue MBeans are associated with individual resources such as connection
services, connections, or destinations, or with whole categories of
resources, such as the set of all destinations on a broker. There are
separate configuration MBeans and monitor MBeans for setting a
resource&#8217;s configuration properties and monitoring its runtime state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java applications access MBeans through remote method invocation (RMI)
protocols. The MBeans are hosted by an MBean server in the broker, which
functions as an MBean container. The MBean server is accessed by means
of a RMI connector, which is used to obtain an MBean server connection,
which, in turn, provides access to the individual MBeans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JMX specification defines an architecture that enables the
programmatic management of any distributed resource. This architecture
is defined by design patterns, APIs, and various services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JMX-based administration provides dynamic, fine grained, programmatic
access to the broker. You can use this kind of administration in a
number of ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can include JMX code in your JMS client application to monitor
application performance and, based on the results, to reconfigure the
Message Queue resources you use to improve performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can write JMX client applications that monitor the broker to
identify use patterns and performance problems, and you can use the JMX
API to reconfigure the broker to optimize performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can write a JMX client application to automate regular maintenance
tasks, rolling upgrades, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can write a JMX client application that constitutes your own
version of the Command utility (<code>imqcmd</code>), and you can use it instead of
<code>imqcmd</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the standard Java Monitoring and Management Console
(jconsole) that provides standard web browser access to the broker&#8217;s
MBeans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JMX is the Java standard for building management applications and is
widely used for managing Java EE infrastructure. If your Message Queue
client is a part of a larger Java EE deployment, JMX support allows you
to use a standard programmatic management framework throughout your Java
EE application. Message Queue is based on the JMX 1.2 specification,
which is part of JDK 1.5.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In developing a client component, it&#8217;s best to keep administrative work
to a minimum. The Message Queue product is designed to help you do this
and can be used out of the box. It should be enough just to start the
broker. The following practices allow you to focus on development:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use default implementations of the data store (built-in file
persistence), the user repository (file-based), and access control
properties file. These are adequate for developmental testing. The
default user repository is created with default entries that allow you
to use the broker immediately after installation. You can use the
default user name (<code>guest</code>) and password (<code>guest</code>) to authenticate a
client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a simple file-system object store by creating a directory for that
purpose, and store administered objects there. You can also instantiate
administered objects directly in code if you prefer not to create an
object store at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use auto-created physical destinations rather than explicitly creating
destinations on the broker. See the appropriate developer&#8217;s guide for
information.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="_supporting_a_production_environment">Supporting a Production Environment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a production environment, message service management plays a key role
in application performance and in meeting the enterprise requirements
for scaling, availability, and security. In this environment, the
administrator has many more tasks to perform. These can be roughly
divided into setup and maintenance operations.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_setup_operations">Setup Operations</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, you have to perform the following setup operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Secure administrative access<br>
Whether you use a file-based or LDAP user repository, make sure that the
administrator is in the <code>admin</code> group and has a secure password. If
necessary, create a secure connection to the broker for the
administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure client access<br>
Whether you use a file-based or LDAP user repository, populate the user
repository with the names of users who can access the message service
and edit the access control properties file to give them appropriate
authorization. If necessary set up SSL-based connection services. To
prevent unauthenticated connections, be sure to change the "guest"
user&#8217;s password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and configure physical destinations<br>
Set destination attributes so that the number of messages and the amount
of memory allocated for messages can be supported by broker resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and configure administered objects.<br>
If you want to use an LDAP object store, configure and set up the store.
Create and configure connection factory and destination administered
objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If horizontal scaling and/or message service availability is required,
create a broker cluster.<br>
For a conventional broker cluster, create a cluster configuration file
and designate a master broker.<br>
For an enhanced broker cluster, create a cluster configuration file that
specifies property values for enhanced cluster mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
