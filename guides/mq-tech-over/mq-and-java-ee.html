<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a specification for a
standard server platform hosting multi-tier, distributed enterprise
applications. One of the requirements of Java EE is that distributed
components be able to interact through reliable, asynchronous messaging.
This interaction is enabled through the use of a JMS provider. In fact,
Message Queue is the reference JMS implementation for Java EE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter explores the ramifications of implementing JMS support in a
Java EE platform environment. The chapter covers the following topics:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the general JMS client programming model introduced in
<a href="client-programming-model.html#aerbg">Client Programming Model</a>, there
is a more specialized adaptation of a JMS client used in the context of
Java EE platform applications. This specialized client is called a
message-driven bean and is one of a family of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
components described in the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/docs.html">EJB 2.0 (and later)
Specification</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message-driven beans provide asynchronous messaging; other EJB
components (session beans and entity beans) can only be called
synchronously, through standard EJB interfaces. However, enterprise
applications often need asynchronous messaging, to allow server-side
components to communicate without tying up server resources. Any
application whose server-side components must respond to application
events needs an EJB component that can receive and consume messages
without being tightly coupled to the message producer. In enterprise
applications, this capability must also scale under increasing load.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A message-driven bean (MDB) is an EJB component supported by a
specialized EJB container, that provides distributed services for the
components it supports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An MDB implements the JMS <code>MessageListener</code> interface. The <code>onMessage</code>
method (written by the MDB developer) is invoked when the MDB container
receives a message. The <code>onMessage()</code> method consumes the message, just
as the <code>onMessage()</code> method of a standard <code>MessageListener</code> object
would. (You do not remotely invoke methods on MDBs as you do on other
EJB components: therefore there are no home or remote interfaces
associated with them.) Each MDB can consume messages from only a single
destination. The messages can be produced by standalone JMS
applications, JMS components, or EJB components, as shown in the
following figure.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="img/to_mdbmessaging.png" alt="Diagram showing JMS message producers sending messages to consuming MDB instances in a Java EE environment."></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A specialized EJB container supports the MDB. This MDB container creates
instances of the MDB and sets them up for asynchronous consumption of
messages. The container sets up a connection with the broker (including
authentication), creates a pool of sessions associated with a given
destination, and manages the distribution of messages among the pooled
sessions. Since the container controls the life cycle of MDB instances,
it manages the pool of MDB instances to accommodate incoming message
loads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Associated with each MDB is a deployment descriptor that specifies the
connection factory attributes and destination properties that the
container uses in setting up message consumption. The deployment
descriptor can also include other information needed by deployment tools
to configure the container. Each such container supports all instances
of a single MDB.</p>

<h3 id="_java_ee_application_server_support">Java EE Application Server Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Java EE architecture, EJB containers are provided by Java EE
application servers. An application server supports these containers by
providing resources they need, such as transaction managers, persistence
managers, name services, and, in the case of messaging and MDBs, a JMS
provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For information about Java EE architecture, see the Java EE Platform
Specification located at
<code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/index.html</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Java EE also provides a standardized way of plugging in external
resources needed by an application server. The standard, defined by the
Java EE Connector Architecture (J2EECA) 1.5 specification, allows an
application server to interact with external systems by way of a
resource adapter. External systems can include, among others, JMS
messaging systems, as implemented by a JMS provider.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plugging a JMS resource adapter into an application server allows Java
EE components deployed and running in the application server to exchange
JMS messages. The JMS connection factory and destination administered
objects needed by these components can be created and configured using
Java EE application server administration tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other administrative operations, however, such as managing a broker and
physical destinations, are not included in the J2EECA specification and
can be performed only through provider-specific tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue includes a JMS resource adapter that consists of a single
file (<code>imqjmsra.rar)</code> located in a directory that depends on the
operating system (see "<a href="../mq-admin-guide/jmsra-properties.html#GMADG00051">JMS Resource Adapter Property
Reference</a>" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide). The
<code>imqjmsra.rar</code> file contains the JAR files needed by the application
server to support JMS messaging, as well as the resource adapter
deployment descriptor (<code>ra.xml</code>) used to deploy the resource adapter in
a Java EE application server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can deploy the Message Queue resource adapter in Java
EE-1.4-compliant application servers by following the resource adapter
deployment and configuration instructions provided by each application
server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of the GlassFish Server, however, Message Queue is already
integrated, by default, as the application server&#8217;s native JMS provider.
Hence, no deployment of the Message Queue resource adapter is required.</p>
