<p>SOAP is a protocol that allows for the exchange of data whose structure
is defined by an XML scheme. Using Message Queue, you can send JMS
messages that contain a SOAP payload. This allows you to transport SOAP
messages reliably and to publish SOAP messages to JMS subscribers. This
chapter covers the following topics:</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_soap">What is SOAP?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SOAP, the Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol that allows the
exchange of structured data between peers in a decentralized,
distributed environment. The structure of the data being exchanged is
specified by an XML scheme.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that SOAP messages are encoded in XML makes SOAP messages
portable, because XML is a portable, system-independent way of
representing data. By representing data using XML, you can access data
from legacy systems as well as share your data with other enterprises.
The data integration offered by XML also makes this technology a natural
for Web-based computing such as Web services. Firewalls can recognize
SOAP packets based on their content type (<code>text/xml-SOAP</code>) and can
filter messages based on information exposed in the SOAP message header.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SOAP specification describes a set of conventions for exchanging XML
messages. As such, it forms a natural foundation for Web services that
also need to exchange information encoded in XML. Although any two
partners could define their own protocol for carrying on this exchange,
having a standard such as SOAP allows developers to build the generic
pieces that support this exchange. These pieces might be software that
adds functionality to the basic SOAP exchange, or might be tools that
administer SOAP messaging, or might even comprise parts of an operating
system that supports SOAP processing. Once this support is put in place,
other developers can focus on creating the Web services themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SOAP protocol is fully described at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP" class="bare">http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP</a>. This
section restricts itself to discussing the reasons why you would use
SOAP and to describing basic concepts that will make it easier to work
with SOAP messages.</p>

<h4 id="_soap_with_attachments_api_for_java">SOAP with Attachments API for Java</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Soap with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) is a JAVA-based API that
enforces compliance to the SOAP standard. When you use this API to
assemble and disassemble SOAP messages, it ensures the construction of
syntactically correct SOAP messages. SAAJ also makes it possible to
automate message processing when several applications need to handle
different parts of a message before forwarding it to the next recipient.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_transport_layer">The Transport Layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Underlying any messaging system is the transport or wire protocol that
governs the serialization of the message as it is sent across a wire and
the interpretation of the message bits when it gets to the other side.
Although SOAP messages can be sent using any number of protocols, the
SOAP specification defines only the binding with HTTP. SOAP uses the
HTTP request/response message model. It provides SOAP request parameters
in an HTTP request and SOAP response parameters in an HTTP response. The
HTTP binding has the advantage of allowing SOAP messages to go through
firewalls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_soap_layer">The SOAP Layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above the transport layer is the SOAP layer. This layer, which is
defined in the SOAP Specification, specifies the XML scheme used to
identify the message parts: envelope, header, body, and attachments. All
SOAP message parts and contents, except for the attachments, are written
in XML. The following sample SOAP message shows how XML tags are used to
define a SOAP message:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">&lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope
   xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
   SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=
           "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"&gt;
      &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
          &lt;m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m="Some-URI"&gt;
              &lt;symbol&gt;DIS&lt;/symbol&gt;
          &lt;/m:GetLastTradePrice&gt;
      &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;
&lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wire transport and SOAP layers are actually sufficient to do SOAP
messaging. You could create an XML document that defines the message you
want to send, and you could write HTTP commands to send the message from
one side and to receive it on the other. In this case, the client is
limited to sending synchronous messages to a specified URL.
Unfortunately, the scope and reliability of this kind of messaging is
severely restricted. To overcome these limitations, the provider and
profile layers are added to SOAP messaging.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_language_implementation_layer">The Language Implementation Layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A language implementation allows you to create XML messages that conform
to SOAP, using API calls. For example, the SAAJ implementation of SOAP,
allows a Java client to construct a SOAP message and all its parts as
Java objects. The client would also use SAAJ to create a connection and
use it to send the message. Likewise, a Web service written in Java
could use the same implementation (SAAJ), or any other language
implementation, to receive the message, to disassemble it, and to
acknowledge its receipt.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_profiles_layer">The Profiles Layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to a language implementation, a SOAP implementation can
offer services that relate to message delivery. These could include
reliability, persistence, security, and administrative control, and are
typically delivered by a SOAP messaging provider. These services will be
provided for SOAP messaging by Message Queue in future releases.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because SOAP providers must all construct and deconstruct messages as
defined by the SOAP specification, clients and services using SOAP are
interoperable. That is, as shown in <a href="#gbovh">Figure 6-2</a>, the client
and the service doing SOAP messaging do not need to be written in the
same language nor do they need to use the same SOAP provider. It is only
the packaging of the message that must be standard.</p>

<p>In order for a SAAJ client or service to interoperate with a service or
client using a different implementation, the parties must agree on two
things:</p>

<p>They must use the same transport bindings&#8212;&#8203;that is, the same wire

<h4 id="_the_soap_message">The SOAP Message</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having surveyed the SOAP messaging layers, let&#8217;s examine the SOAP
message itself. Although the work of rendering a SOAP message in XML is
taken care of by the SAAJ implementation, you must still understand its
structure in order to make the SAAJ calls in the right order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A SOAP message is an XML document that consists of a SOAP envelope, an
optional SOAP header, and a SOAP body. The SOAP message header contains
information that allows the message to be routed through one or more
intermediate nodes before it reaches its final destination.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The envelope is the root element of the XML document representing the
message. It defines the framework for how the message should be handled
and by whom. Once it encounters the Envelope element, the SOAP processor
knows that the XML is a SOAP message and can then look for the
individual parts of the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The header is a generic mechanism for adding features to a SOAP
message. It can contain any number of child elements that define
extensions to the base protocol. For example, header child elements
might define authentication information, transaction information, locale
information, and so on. The actors, the software that handle the message
may, without prior agreement, use this mechanism to define who should
deal with a feature and whether the feature is mandatory or optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The body is a container for mandatory information intended for the
ultimate recipient of the message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A SOAP message may also contain an attachment, which does not have to be
in XML. For more information, see <a href="#aeqfg">SOAP Packaging Models</a>
next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A SOAP message is constructed like a nested matrioshka doll. When you
use SAAJ to assemble or disassemble a message, you need to make the API
calls in the appropriate order to get to the message part that interests
you. For example, in order to add content to the message, you need to
get to the body part of the message. To do this you need to work through
the nested layers: SOAP part, SOAP envelope, SOAP body, until you get to
the SOAP body element that you will use to specify your data. For more
information, see <a href="#aeqfi">The SOAP Message Object</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_soap_packaging_models">SOAP Packaging Models</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SOAP specification describes two models of SOAP messages: one that
is encoded entirely in XML and one that allows the sender to add an
attachment containing non-XML data. You should look over the following
two figures and note the parts of the SOAP message for each model. When
you use SAAJ to define SOAP messages and their parts, it will be helpful
for you to be familiar with this information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#gbovm">Figure 6-3</a> shows the SOAP model without attachments. This
package includes a SOAP envelope, a header, and a body. The header is
optional.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you construct a SOAP message using SAAJ, you do not have to specify
which model you&#8217;re following. If you add an attachment, a message like
that shown in <a href="#gbovi">Figure 6-4</a> is constructed; if you don&#8217;t, a
message like that shown in <a href="#gbovm">Figure 6-3</a> is constructed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#gbovm">Figure 6-3</a> shows a SOAP Message with attachments. The
attachment part can contain any kind of content: image files, plain
text, and so on. The sender of a message can choose whether to create a
SOAP message with attachments. The message receiver can also choose
whether to consume an attachment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A message that contains one or more attachments is enclosed in a MIME
envelope that contains all the parts of the message. In SAAJ, the MIME
envelope is automatically produced whenever the client creates an
attachment part. If you add an attachment to a message, you are
responsible for specifying (in the MIME header) the type of data in the
attachment.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the figure, the <code>SOAPMessage</code> object is a collection of
objects divided in two parts: a SOAP part and an attachment part. The
main thing to remember is that the attachment part can contain non-xml
data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SOAP part of the message contains an envelope that contains a body
(which can contain data or fault information) and an optional header.
When you use SAAJ to create a SOAP message, the SOAP part, envelope, and
body are created for you: you need only create the body elements. To do
that you need to get to the parent of the body element, the SOAP body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to reach any object in the SOAPMessage tree, you must traverse
the tree starting from the root, as shown in the following lines of
code. For example, assuming the SOAPMessage is <code>MyMsg</code>, here are the
calls you would have to make in order to get the SOAP body:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">SOAPPart MyPart = MyMsg.getSOAPPart();
SOAPEnvelope MyEnv = MyPart.getEnvelope();
SOAPBody MyBody = envelope.getBody();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, you can create a name for a body element (as described in
<a href="#aeqfk">Namespaces</a>) and add the body element to the SOAPMessage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the following code line creates a name (a representation of
an XML tag) for a body element:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">Name bodyName = envelope.createName("Temperature");</code></pre>

<p>Finally, this code line defines some data for the body element
<code>bodyName</code> :</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An XML namespace is a means of qualifying element and attribute names to
disambiguate them from other names in the same document. This section
provides a brief description of XML namespaces and how they are used in
SOAP. For complete information, see
<code>http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/</code></p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The declaration defines prefix as an alias for the specified URI. In the
element <code>myElement</code>, you can use prefix with any element or attribute to
specify that the element or attribute name belongs to the namespace
specified by the URI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is an example of a namespace declaration:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A SOAP message is sent to an endpoint by way of a point-to-point
connection (implemented by the <code>SOAPConnection</code> class).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You use point-to-point connections to establish a request-reply
messaging model. The request-reply model is illustrated in
<a href="#gboxm">Figure 6-6</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this model, the client does the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creates an endpoint that specifies the URL that will be passed to the
<code>SOAPConnection.call</code> method that sends the message.<br>
See <a href="#aeqfp">Endpoint</a> for a discussion of the different ways of
creating an endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates a SOAPConnection factory and obtains a SOAP connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates a message factory and uses it to create a SOAP message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates a name for the content of the message and adds the content to
the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses the <code>SOAPConnection.call</code> method to send the message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is assumed that the client will ignore the <code>SOAPMessage</code> object
returned by the call method because the only reason this object is
returned is to unblock the client.</p>

<h4 id="_working_with_attachments">Working with Attachments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a message contains any data that is not XML, you must add it to the
message as an attachment. A message can have any number of attachment
parts. Each attachment part can contain anything from plain text to
image files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create an attachment, you must create a URL object that specifies the
location of the file that you want to attach to the SOAP message. You
must also create a data handler that will be used to interpret the data
in the attachment. Finally, you need to add the attachment to the SOAP
message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create and add an attachment part to the message, you need to use the
JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) API. This API allows you to
determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data, encapsulate access to
it, discover the operations available on it, and activate a bean that
can perform these operations. You must include the <code>activation.jar</code>
library in your application code in order to work with the JavaBeans
Activation Framework.</p>

<p>A SOAP service represents the final recipient of a SOAP message and
should currently be implemented as a servlet. You can write your own
servlet or you can extend the <code>JAXMServlet</code> class, which is furnished in
the <code>soap.messaging</code> package for your convenience. This section
describes the task of writing a SOAP service based on the <code>JAXMServlet</code>
class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your servlet must implement either the <code>ReqRespListener</code> or
<code>OneWayListener</code> interfaces. The difference between these two is that
<code>ReqRespListener</code> requires that you return a reply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using either of these interfaces, you must implement a method called
<code>onMessage(SOAPMsg)</code>. <code>JAXMServlet</code> will call <code>onMessage</code> after
receiving a message using the <code>HTTP POST</code> method, which saves you the
work of implementing your own <code>doPost()</code> method to convert the incoming
message into a SOAP message.</p>

<h3 id="_integrating_soap_and_message_queue">Integrating SOAP and Message Queue</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section explains how you can send, receive, and process a JMS
message that contains a SOAP payload.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue provides a utility to help you send and receive SOAP
messages using the JMS API. With the support it provides, you can
convert a SOAP message into a JMS message and take advantage of the
reliable messaging service offered by Message Queue. You can then
convert the message back into a SOAP message on the receiving side and
use SAAJ to process it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To send, receive, and process a JMS message that contains a SOAP
payload, you must do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Import the library <code>com.sun.messaging.xml.MessageTransformer</code> . This
is the utility whose methods you will use to convert SOAP messages to
JMS messages and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you transport a SOAP message, you must call the
<code>MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageIntoJMSMessage</code> method. This method
transforms the SOAP message into a JMS message. You then send the
resulting JMS message as you would a normal JMS message. For programming
simplicity, it would be best to select a destination that is dedicated
to receiving SOAP messages. That is, you should create a particular
queue or topic as a destination for your SOAP message and then send only
SOAP messages to this destination.<br></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Message myMsg= MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageIntoJMSMessage
                             (SOAPMessage, Session);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Session</code> argument specifies the session to be used in producing the
<code>Message</code>.
* On the receiving side, you get the JMS message containing the SOAP
payload as you would a normal JMS message. You then call the
<code>MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageFromJMSMessage</code> utility to extract the
SOAP message, and then use SAAJ to disassemble the SOAP message and do
any further processing. For example, to obtain the SOAPMessage make a
call like the following:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">SOAPMessage myMsg= MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageFromJMSMessage
                             (Message, MessageFactory);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>MessageFactory</code> argument specifies a message factory that the
utility should use to construct the <code>SOAPMessage</code> from the given JMS
<code>Message</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections offer several use cases and code examples to
illustrate this process.</p>

<p>In the first example, illustrated in <a href="#gboyc">Figure 6-9</a>, an
incoming SOAP message is received by a servlet. After receiving the SOAP
message, the servlet <code>MyServlet</code> uses the <code>MessageTransformer</code> utility
to transform the message into a JMS message, and (reliably) forwards it
to an application that receives it, turns it back into a SOAP message,
and processes the contents of the SOAP message.</p>
