<p>This chapter describes Message Queue&#8217;s facilities for security-related
administration tasks, such as configuring user authentication, defining
access control, configuring a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection
service to encrypt client-broker communication, and setting up a
password file for administrator account passwords. In addition to
Message Queue&#8217;s own built-in authentication mechanisms, you can also
plug in a preferred external service based on the Java Authentication

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue provides security services for user access control
(authentication and authorization) and for encryption:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Authentication ensures that only verified users can establish a
connection to a broker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authorization specifies which users or groups have the right to access
resources and to perform specific operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encryption protects messages from being tampered with during delivery
over a connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Message Queue administrator, you are responsible for setting up the
information the broker needs to authenticate users and authorize their
actions. The broker properties pertaining to security services are
listed under <a href="broker-properties.html#aeony">Security Properties</a>. The
boolean property <code>imq.accesscontrol.enabled</code> acts as a master switch
that controls whether access control is applied on a brokerwide basis;
for finer control, you can override this setting for a particular
connection service by setting the <code>imq.`serviceName
`.accesscontrol.enabled</code> property, where serviceName is the name of the
connection service, as shown in <a href="connection-services.html#gbnjw">Table
6-1</a>: for example, <code>imq.httpjms.accesscontrol.enabled</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following figure shows the components used by the broker to provide
authentication and authorization services. These services depend on a
user repository containing information about the users of the messaging
system: their names, passwords, and group memberships. In addition, to
authorize specific operations for a user or group, the broker consults
an access control file that specifies which operations a user or group
can perform. You can designate a single access control file for the
broker as a whole, using the configuration property
<code>imq.accesscontrol.file.filename</code>, or for a single connection service
with <code>imq</code>.serviceName. <code>accesscontrol.file.filename</code>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As <a href="#ggydo">Figure 9-1</a> shows, you can store user data in a flat file
user repository that is provided with the Message Queue service, you can
access an existing LDAP repository, or you can plug in a Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) module.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you choose a flat-file repository, you must use the <code>imqusermgr</code>
utility to manage the repository. This option is easy to use and
built-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to use an existing LDAP server, you use the tools provided
by the LDAP vendor to populate and manage the user repository. You must
also set properties in the broker instance configuration file to enable
the broker to query the LDAP server for information about users and
groups.<br>
The LDAP option is better if scalability is important or if you need the
repository to be shared by different brokers. This might be the case if
you are using broker clusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to plug-in an existing JAAS authentication service, you
need to set the corresponding properties in the broker instance
configuration file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The broker&#8217;s <code>imq.authentication.basic.user_repository</code> property
specifies which type of repository to use. In general, an LDAP
repository or JAAS authentication service is preferable if scalability
is important or if you need the repository to be shared by different
brokers (if you are using broker clusters, for instance). See
<a href="#aeofg">User Authentication</a> for more information on setting up a
flat-file user repository, LDAP access, or JAAS authentication service.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_authentication">Authentication</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A client requesting a connection to a broker must supply a user name and
password, which the broker compares with those stored in the user
repository. Passwords transmitted from client to broker are encoded
using either base-64 encoding (for flat-file repositories) or message
digest (MD5) hashing (for LDAP repositories). The choice is controlled
by the <code>imq.authentication.type</code> property for the broker as a whole, or
by <code>imq</code>.serviceName. <code>authentication.type</code> for a specific connection
service. The <code>imq.authentication.client.response.timeout</code> property sets
a timeout interval for authentication requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described under <a href="#aeogq">Password Files</a>, you can choose to put
your passwords in a password file instead of being prompted for them
interactively. The boolean broker property <code>imq</code>.<code>passfile.enabled</code>
controls this option. If this property is true, the
<code>imq.passfile.dirpath</code> and <code>imq.passfile.name</code> properties give the
directory path and file name for the password file. The
<code>imq.imqcmd.password</code> property (which can be embedded in the password
file) specifies the password for authenticating an administrative user
to use the Command utility (<code>imqcmd</code>) for managing brokers, connection
services, connections, physical destinations, durable subscriptions, and
transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using an LDAP-based user repository, there are a whole range
of broker properties available for configuring various aspects of the
LDAP lookup. The address (host name and port number) of the LDAP server
itself is specified by <code>imq.user_repository.ldap.server</code>. The
<code>imq.user_repository.ldap.principal</code> property gives the distinguished
name for binding to the LDAP repository, while
<code>imq.user_repository.ldap.password</code> supplies the associated password.
Other properties specify the directory bases and optional JNDI filters
for individual user and group searches, the provider-specific attribute
identifiers for user and group names, and so forth; see
<a href="broker-properties.html#aeony">Security Properties</a> for details.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_authorization">Authorization</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once authenticated, a user can be authorized to perform various Message
Queue-related activities. As a Message Queue administrator, you can
define user groups and assign individual users membership in them. The
default access control file explicitly refers to only one group, <code>admin</code>
(see <a href="#aeofm">User Groups and Status</a>). A user in this group has
connection permission for the <code>admin</code> connection service, which allows
the user to perform administrative functions such as creating
destinations and monitoring and controlling a broker. A user in any
other group that you define cannot, by default, get an <code>admin</code> service
connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a user attempts to perform an operation, the broker checks the
user&#8217;s name and group membership (from the user repository) against
those specified for access to that operation (in the access control
file). The access control file specifies permissions to users or groups
for the following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connecting to a broker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accessing destinations: creating a consumer, a producer, or a queue
browser for any given destination or for all destinations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-creating destinations</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_encryption">Encryption</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To encrypt messages sent between clients and broker, you need to use a
connection service based on the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) standard. SSL
provides security at the connection level by establishing an encrypted
connection between an SSL-enabled broker and client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use an SSL-based Message Queue connection service, you generate a
public/private key pair using the Message Queue Key Tool utility
(<code>imqkeytool</code>). This utility embeds the public key in a self-signed
certificate and places it in a Message Queue key store. The key store is
itself password-protected; to unlock it, you must provide a key store
password at startup time, specified by the <code>imq.keystore.password</code>
property. Once the key store is unlocked, a broker can pass the
certificate to any client requesting a connection. The client then uses
the certificate to set up an encrypted connection to the broker.</p>

<h3 id="_user_authentication">User Authentication</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users attempting to connect to a Message Queue message broker must
provide a user name and password for authentication. The broker will
grant the connection only if the name and password match those in a
broker-specific user repository listing the authorized users and their
passwords. Each broker instance can have its own user repository, which
you as an administrator are responsible for maintaining. This section
tells how to create, populate, and manage the user repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue can support any of three types of authentication
mechanism:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A flat-file repository that is shipped with Message Queue. This type
of repository is very easy to populate and manage, using the Message
Queue User Manager utility (<code>imqusermgr</code>). See <a href="#aeofh">Using a
Flat-File User Repository</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server. This could be a
new or existing LDAP directory server using the LDAP v2 or v3 protocol.
You use the tools provided by the LDAP vendor to populate and manage the
user repository. This type of repository is not as easy to use as the
flat-file repository, but it is more scalable and therefore better for
production environments. See <a href="#aeofr">Using an LDAP User Repository</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An external authentication mechanism plugged into Message Queue by
means of the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) API.
See <a href="#gepfq">Using JAAS-Based Authentication</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_using_a_flat_file_user_repository">Using a Flat-File User Repository</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue provides a built-in flat-file user repository and a
command line tool, the User Manager utility (<code>imqusermgr</code>), for
populating and managing it. Each broker has its own flat-file user
repository, created automatically when you start the broker. By default,
the user repository resides in a file named <code>passwd</code>, in a directory
identified by the name of the broker instance with which the repository
is associated:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">IMQ_VARHOME/instances/instanceName/etc/passwd</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have changed these file name or directory defaults using the
<code>imq.user_repository.file.filename</code> or
<code>imq.user_repository.file.dirpath</code> broker properties, you must use the
<code>-D</code> option to specify the non-default values when running <code>imqusermgr</code>
if you did not specify the values in the broker properties file. For
example, if <code>imq.user_repository.file.dirpath</code> is specified in a cluster
configuration file, start <code>imqusermgr</code> using the form:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">imqusermgr -Dimq.cluster.url=location-of-cluster-properties-file ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As another example, if <code>imq.user_repository.file.filename</code> is specified
on the <code>imqbrokerd</code> command line to start the broker, start <code>imqusermgr</code>
using the form:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">imqusermgr -Dimq.user_repository.file.filename=filename-used-in-imqbrokerd-command ...</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="aeofm"></a><a id="GMADG00404"></a><a id="user-groups-and-status"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_user_groups_and_status">User Groups and Status</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each user in the repository can be assigned to a user group, which
defines the default access privileges granted to all of its members. You
can then specify authorization rules to further restrict these access
privileges for specific users, as described in <a href="#aeofu">User
Authorization</a>. A user&#8217;s group is assigned when the user entry is first
created, and cannot be changed thereafter. The only way to reassign a
user to a different group is to delete the original user entry and add
another entry specifying the new group.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flat-file user repository provides three predefined groups:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>admin</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>For broker administrators. By default, users in this group are granted
the access privileges needed to configure, administer, and manage
message brokers.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>user</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>For normal (non-administrative) client users. Newly created user
entries are assigned to this group unless otherwise specified. By
default, users in this group can connect to all Message Queue
connection services of type <code>NORMAL</code>, produce messages to or consume
messages from all physical destinations, and browse messages in any
queue.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><code>anonymous</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>For Message Queue clients that do not wish to use a user name known to
the broker (for instance, because they do not know of a real user name
to use). This group is analogous to the anonymous account provided by
most FTPservers. No more than one user at a time can be assigned to
this group. You should restrict the access privileges of this group in
comparison to the <code>user</code> group, or remove users from the group at
deployment time.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You cannot rename or delete these predefined groups or create new ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to its group, each user entry in the repository has a user
status: either active or inactive . New user entries added to the
repository are marked active by default. Changing a user&#8217;s status to
inactive rescinds all of that user&#8217;s access privileges, making the user
unable to open new broker connections. Such inactive entries are
retained in the user repository, however, and can be reactivated at a
later time. If you attempt to add a new user with the same name as an
inactive user already in the repository, the operation will fail; you
must either delete the inactive user entry or give the new user a
different name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow the broker to be used immediately after installation without
further intervention by the administrator, the flat-file user repository
is created with two initial entries, summarized in <a href="#gbnkj">Table
9-1</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>admin</code> entry (user name and password <code>admin</code>/<code>admin</code>) enables you
to administer the broker with Command utility (<code>imqcmd</code>) commands.
Immediately on installation, you should update this initial entry to
change its password (see <a href="#gewbm">Changing a User&#8217;s Password</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>guest</code> entry allows clients to connect to the broker using a
default user name and password (<code>guest</code>/<code>guest</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can then proceed to add any additional user entries you need for
individual users of your message service.</p>

<p>JAAS is a core API in Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE), and is therefore
an integral part of Message Queue&#8217;s runtime environment. It defines an
abstraction layer between an application and an authentication
mechanism, allowing the desired mechanism to be plugged in with no
change to application code. In the case of the Message Queue service,
the abstraction layer lies between the broker (application) and an
authentication provider. By setting a few broker properties, it is
possible to plug in any JAAS-compliant authentication service and to
upgrade this service with no disruption or change to broker code.</p>

<p>The JAAS client is an application wishing to perform authentication

login module can call to obtain the user name, password, and other
information needed for authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JAAS-compliant authentication service consists of one or more
login modules along with logic to perform the needed authentication. The
login module (<code>LoginModule</code>) may include the authentication logic
itself, or it may use a private protocol or API to communicate with an
external security service that provides the logic.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authentication service layer, consisting of one or more login
modules (if needed) and corresponding authentication logic, is separate
from the broker. The login modules run in the same Java virtual machine
as the broker. The broker is represented to the login module as a login
context, and communicates with the login module by means of a callback
handler that is part of the broker runtime code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The authentication service also supplies a JAAS configuration file
containing entries that reference the login modules. The configuration
file specifies the order in which the login modules (if more than one)
are to be used and any conditions for their use. When the broker starts
up, it locates the configuration file by consulting either the Java
system property <code>java.security.auth.login.config</code> or the Java security
properties file. The broker then selects an entry in the JAAS
configuration file according to the value of the broker property
<code>imq.user_repository.jaas.name</code>. That entry specifies which login
module(s) will be used for authentication. The classes for the login
modules are found in the Message Queue external resource files
directory, <code>IMQ_HOMElib/ext</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relation between the configuration file, the login module, and the
broker is shown in the following figure. <a href="#ghezq">Figure 9-4</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fact that the broker uses a JAAS plug-in authentication service
remains completely transparent to the Message Queue client. The client
continues to connect to the broker as it did before, passing a user name
and password. In turn, the broker uses a callback handler to pass login
information to the authentication service, and the service uses the
information to authenticate the user and return the results. If
authentication succeeds, the broker grants the connection; if it fails,
the client runtime returns a JMS security exception that the client must
handle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the Message Queue client is authenticated, if there is further
authorization to be done, the broker proceeds as it normally would,
consulting the access control file to determine whether the
authenticated client is authorized to perform the actions it undertakes:
accessing a destination, consuming a message, browsing a queue, and so
on.</p>

<p>An access control file contains rules that specify which users (or

message broker. These operations include the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a connection</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If access control is enabled (that is, if the broker&#8217;s
<code>imq.accesscontrol.enabled</code> configuration property is set to <code>true</code>, the
broker will consult its access control file whenever a client attempts
one of these operations, to verify whether the user generating the
request (or a group to which the user belongs) is authorized to perform
the operation. By editing this file, you can restrict access to these
operations to particular users and groups. Changes take effect
immediately; there is no need to restart the broker after editing the
file.</p>

<h4 id="_using_self_signed_certificates">Using Self-Signed Certificates</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use an SSL-based connection service over TCP /IP, you generate a
public/private key pair using the Key Tool utility (<code>imqkeytool</code>). This
utility embeds the public key in a self-signed certificate that is
passed to any client requesting a connection to the broker, and the
client uses the certificate to set up an encrypted connection. This
section describes how to set up an SSL-based service using such
self-signed certificates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a stronger level of authentication, you can use signed certificates
verified by a certification authority. The use of signed certificates
involves some additional steps beyond those needed for self-signed
certificates: you must first perform the procedures described in this
section and then perform the additional steps in <a href="#aeogk">Using
Signed Certificates</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message Queue&#8217;s support for SSL with self-signed certificates is
oriented toward securing on-the-wire data, on the assumption that the
client is communicating with a known and trusted server. Configuring SSL
with self-signed certificates requires configuration on both the broker
and client:</p>

<p>Starting with release 4.0, the default value for the client connection
factory property <code>imqSSLIsHostTrusted</code> is <code>false</code>. If your application
depends on the prior default value of <code>true</code>, you need to reconfigure
and to set the property explicitly to <code>true</code>. In particular, old or new
clients using self-signed certificates should set this property to true;
for example:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The administration tool <code>imqcmd</code> is also affected by this change. In
addition to using the <code>-secure</code> option to specify that it uses a
SSL-based <code>admin</code> connection service, the <code>imqSSLIsHostTrusted</code> should
be set to <code>true</code> when connecting to a broker configured with a
self-signed certificate. You can do this as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">imqcmd list svc -secure -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true</code></pre>

<h4 id="_using_signed_certificates">Using Signed Certificates</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Signed certificates provide a stronger level of server authentication
than self-signed certificates. You can implement signed certificates
only between a client and broker, and currently not between multiple
brokers in a cluster. This requires the following extra procedures in
addition to the ones described in <a href="#aeogd">Using Self-Signed
Certificates</a>. Using signed certificates requires configuration on both
the broker and client:</p>

<p>To Obtain a Signed Certificate</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Use the J2SE <code>keytool</code> command to generate a certificate signing
request (CSR) for the self-signed certificate you generated in the
preceding section.<br>
Information about the <code>keytool</code> command can be found at</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html</code><br>
Here is an example:<br></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>keytool  -certreq  -keyalg RSA  -alias imq  -file certreq.csr
-keystore /etc/imq/keystore  -storepass  myStorePassword</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This generates a CSR encapsulating the certificate in the specified file
(<code>certreq.csr</code> in the example).
2.  Use the CSR to generate or request a signed certificate.<br>
You can do this by either of the following methods:
* Have the certificate signed by a well known certification authority
(CA), such as Thawte or Verisign. See your CA&#8217;s documentation for more
information on how to do this.
* Sign the certificate yourself, using an SSL signing software package.<br>
The resulting signed certificate is a sequence of ASCII characters. If
you receive the signed certificate from a CA, it may arrive as an e-mail
attachment or in the text of a message.
3.  Save the signed certificate in a file.<br>
The instructions below use the example name <code>broker.cer</code> to represent
the broker certificate.</p>

<li>
<p>Check whether J2SE supports your certification authority by default.<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your CA is listed, skip the next step.
2.  If your certification authority is not supported in J2SE, import the
CA&#8217;s root certificate into the Message Queue key store.<br>
Here is an example:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">keytool  -import  -alias ca  -file ca.cer  -noprompt  -trustcacerts

<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <code>ca.cer</code> is the file containing the root certificate obtained from
the CA.<br>
If you are using a CA test certificate, you probably need to import the
test CA root certificate. Your CA should have instructions on how to
obtain a copy.
3.  Import the signed certificate into the key store to replace the
original self-signed certificate.<br>
Here is an example:<br></p>

<p>To Configure the Client Runtime to Require Signed Certificates</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Verify whether the signing authority is registered in the client&#8217;s
trust store.<br>
To test whether the client will accept certificates signed by your
certification authority, try to establish an SSL connection, as
described above under <a href="#aeogh">Configuring and Running an SSL-Based
Client Using Self-Signed Certificates</a>. If the CA is in the client&#8217;s
trust store, the connection will succeed and you can skip the next step.
If the connection fails with a certificate validation error, go on to
the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the signing CA&#8217;s root certificate in the client&#8217;s trust
store.<br>
The client searches the key store files <code>cacerts</code> and <code>jssecacerts</code> by
default, so no further configuration is necessary if you install the
certificate in either of those files. The following example installs a
test root certificate from the Verisign certification authority from a
file named <code>testrootca.cer</code> into the default system certificate file,
<code>cacerts</code>. The example assumes that J2SE is installed in the directory
<code>$JAVA_HOME/usr/j2se</code>:<br></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>keytool  -import  -keystore /usr/j2se/jre/lib/security/cacerts
-alias VerisignTestCA  -file testrootca.cer  -noprompt
-trustcacerts  -storepass myStorePassword</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternative (and recommended) option is to install the root
certificate into the alternative system certificate file, <code>jssecacerts</code>:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">keytool  -import  -keystore /usr/j2se/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts
-alias VerisignTestCA  -file testrootca.cer  -noprompt
-trustcacerts  -storepass myStorePassword</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A third possibility is to install the root certificate into some other
key store file and configure the client to use that as its trust store.
The following example installs into the file <code>/home/smith/.keystore</code>:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">keytool  -import  -keystore /home/smith/.keystore

-trustcacerts  -storepass myStorePassword</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the client does not search this key store by default, you must
explicitly provide its location to the client to use as a trust store.
You do this by setting the Java system property
<code>javax.net.ssl.trustStore</code> once the client is running:<br></p>

<p>When a client application is separated from the broker by a firewall,

connections are slower than other connection services, however; a faster
alternative is to bypass the Message Queue Port Mapper and explicitly
assign a static port address to the desired connection service, and then
open that specific port in the firewall. This approach can be used to
connect through a firewall using the <code>jms</code> or <code>ssljms</code> connection
