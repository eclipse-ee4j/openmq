Message Queue service to optimize the performance of your messaging

<h4 id="_the_performance_tuning_process">The Performance Tuning Process</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The performance you get out of a messaging application depends on the
interaction between the application and the Message Queue service.
Hence, maximizing performance requires the combined efforts of both the
application developer and the administrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of optimizing performance begins with application design and
continues on through tuning the message service after the application
has been deployed. The performance tuning process includes the following
stages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defining performance requirements for the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing the application taking into account factors that affect
performance (especially tradeoffs between reliability and performance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing baseline performance measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuning or reconfiguring the message service to optimize performance</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process outlined above is often iterative. During deployment of the
application, a Message Queue administrator evaluates the suitability of
the message service for the application&#8217;s general performance
requirements. If the benchmark testing meets these requirements, the
administrator can tune the system as described in this chapter. However,
if benchmark testing does not meet performance requirements, a redesign
of the application might be necessary or the deployment architecture
might need to be modified.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_aspects_of_performance">Aspects of Performance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, performance is a measure of the speed and efficiency with
which a message service delivers messages from producer to consumer.
However, there are several different aspects of performance that might
be important to you, depending on your needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Connection Load</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of message producers, or message consumers, or the number
of concurrent connections a system can support.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Message throughput</dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of messages or message bytes that can be pumped through a
messaging system per second.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Latency</dt>
<dd>
<p>The time it takes a particular message to be delivered from message
producer to message consumer.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Stability</dt>
<dd>
<p>The overall availability of the message service or how gracefully it
degrades in cases of heavy load or failure.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Efficiency</dt>
<dd>
<p>The efficiency of message delivery; a measure of message throughput in
relation to the computing resources employed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These different aspects of performance are generally interrelated. If
message throughput is high, that means messages are less likely to be
backlogged in the broker, and as a result, latency should be low (a
single message can be delivered very quickly). However, latency can
depend on many factors: the speed of communication links, broker
processing speed, and client processing speed, to name a few.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, the aspects of performance that are most important to you
generally depends on the requirements of a particular application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="aeojk"></a><a id="GMADG00602"></a><a id="benchmarks"></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_benchmarks">Benchmarks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Benchmarking is the process of creating a test suite for your messaging
application and of measuring message throughput or other aspects of
performance for this test suite.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you could create a test suite by which some number of
producing clients, using some number of connections, sessions, and
message producers, send persistent or nonpersistent messages of a
standard size to some number of queues or topics (all depending on your
messaging application design) at some specified rate. Similarly, the
test suite includes some number of consuming clients, using some number
of connections, sessions, and message consumers (of a particular type)
that consume the messages in the test suite&#8217;s physical destinations
using a particular acknowledgment mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using your standard test suite you can measure the time it takes between
production and consumption of messages or the average message throughput
rate, and you can monitor the system to observe connection thread usage,
message storage data, message flow data, and other relevant metrics. You
can then ramp up the rate of message production, or the number of
message producers, or other variables, until performance is negatively
affected. The maximum throughput you can achieve is a benchmark for your
message service configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this benchmark, you can modify some of the characteristics of your
test suite. By carefully controlling all the factors that might have an
effect on performance (see <a href="#aeojn">Application Design Factors
Affecting Performance</a>), you can note how changing some of these factors
affects the benchmark. For example, you can increase the number of
connections or the size of messages five-fold or ten-fold, and note the
effect on performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, you can keep application-based factors constant and change
your broker configuration in some controlled way (for example, change
connection properties, thread pool properties, JVM memory limits, limit
behaviors, file-based versus JDBC-based persistence, and so forth) and
note how these changes affect performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This benchmarking of your application provides information that can be
valuable when you want to increase the performance of a deployed
application by tuning your message service. A benchmark allows the
effect of a change or a set of changes to be more accurately predicted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a general rule, benchmarks should be run in a controlled test
environment and for a long enough period of time for your message
service to stabilize. (Performance is negatively affected at startup by
the just-in-time compilation that turns Java code into machine code.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="aeojl"></a><a id="GMADG00603"></a><a id="baseline-use-patterns"></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_baseline_use_patterns">Baseline Use Patterns</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a messaging application is deployed and running, it is important to
establish baseline use patterns. You want to know when peak demand
occurs and you want to be able to quantify that demand. For example,
demand normally fluctuates by number of end users, activity levels, time
of day, or all of these.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To establish baseline use patterns you need to monitor your message
service over an extended period of time, looking at data such as the
following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of connections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of messages stored in the broker (or in particular physical
destinations)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message flows into and out of a broker (or particular physical
destinations)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers of active consumers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use average and peak values provided in metrics data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to check these baseline metrics against design
expectations. By doing so, you are checking that client code is behaving
properly: for example, that connections are not being left open or that
consumed messages are not being left unacknowledged. These coding errors
consume broker resources and could significantly affect performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The base-line use patterns help you determine how to tune your system
for optimal performance. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If one physical destination is used significantly more than others,
you might want to set higher message memory limits on that physical
destination than on others, or to adjust limit behaviors accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number of connections needed is significantly greater than
allowed by the maximum thread pool size, you might want to increase the
thread pool size or adopt a shared thread model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If peak message flows are substantially greater than average flows,
that might influence the limit behaviors you employ when memory runs
low.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the more you know about use patterns, the better you are
able to tune your system to those patterns and to plan for future needs.</p>

<h3 id="_factors_affecting_performance">Factors Affecting Performance</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message latency and message throughput, two of the main performance
indicators, generally depend on the time it takes a typical message to
complete various steps in the message delivery process. These steps are
shown below for the case of a persistent, reliably delivered message.
The steps are described following the illustration.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since these steps are sequential, any one of them can be a potential
bottleneck in the delivery of messages from producing clients to
consuming clients. Most of the steps depend on physical characteristics
of the messaging system: network bandwidth, computer processing speeds,
message service architecture, and so forth. Some, however, also depend
on characteristics of the messaging application and the level of
reliability it requires.</p>

factors and messaging system factors on performance. While application
design and messaging system factors closely interact in the delivery of
messages, each category is considered separately.</p>

<p>One mechanism for ensuring the reliability of JMS message delivery is
for a client to acknowledge consumption of messages delivered to it by
the Message Queue broker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a session is closed without the client acknowledging the message or
if the broker fails before the acknowledgment is processed, the broker
redelivers that message, setting a <code>JMSRedelivered</code> flag.</p>

<p>For a nontransacted session, the client can choose one of three
acknowledgment modes, each of which has its own performance
characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code>. The system automatically acknowledges a message
once the consumer has processed it. This mode guarantees at most one
redelivered message after a provider failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code>. The application controls the point at which
messages are acknowledged. All messages processed in that session since
the previous acknowledgment are acknowledged. If the broker fails while
processing a set of acknowledgments, one or more messages in that group
might be redelivered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE</code>. This mode instructs the system to acknowledge
messages in a lazy manner. Multiple messages can be redelivered after a
provider failure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Using <code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode is similar to using transactions,

<p>Acknowledgment mode affects performance for the following reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extra control messages between broker and client are required in
<code>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> and <code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> modes. The additional
control messages add additional processing overhead and can interfere
with JMS payload messages, causing processing delays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> and <code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> modes, the client must
wait until the broker confirms that it has processed the client&#8217;s
acknowledgment before the client can consume additional messages. (This
broker confirmation guarantees that the broker will not inadvertently
redeliver these messages.)</p>

<h5 id="_use_of_selectors_message_filtering">Use of Selectors (Message Filtering)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application developers often want to target sets of messages to
particular consumers. They can do so either by targeting each set of
messages to a unique physical destination or by using a single physical
destination and registering one or more selectors for each consumer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A selector is a string requesting that only messages with property
values that match the string are delivered to a particular consumer. For
example, the selector <code>NumberOfOrders&gt;1</code> delivers only the messages with
a <code>NumberOfOrders</code> property value of <code>2</code> or more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating consumers with selectors lowers performance (as compared to
using multiple physical destinations) because additional processing is
required to handle each message. When a selector is used, it must be
parsed so that it can be matched against future messages. Additionally,
the message properties of each message must be retrieved and compared
against the selector as each message is routed. However, using selectors
provides more flexibility in a messaging application.</p>

<h5 id="_message_size">Message Size</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Message size affects performance because more data must be passed from
producing client to broker and from broker to consuming client, and
because for persistent messages a larger message must be stored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, by batching smaller messages into a single message, the routing
and processing of individual messages can be minimized, providing an
overall performance gain. In this case, information about the state of
individual messages is lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our tests, which compared throughput in kilobytes per second for 1k,
10k, and 100k-sized messages to a queue destination and
<code>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> acknowledgment mode, we found that nonpersistent
messaging was about 50% faster for 1k messages, about 20% faster for 10k
messages, and about 5% faster for 100k messages. The size of the message
affected performance significantly for both persistent and nonpersistent
messages. 100k messages are about 10 times faster than 10k, and 10k are
about 5 times faster than 1k.</p>

<p>While, in general, the message type is dictated by the needs of an

<p>For both the Message Queue broker and client applications, CPU
processing speed and available memory are primary determinants of

by increasing processing power, while adding memory can increase both
processing speed and capacity. However, it is generally expensive to
overcome bottlenecks simply by upgrading your hardware.</p>

<p>Because of the efficiencies of different operating systems, performance
can vary, even assuming the same hardware platform. For example, the
thread model employed by the operating system can have an important
effect on the number of concurrent connections a broker can support. In

<p>The broker is a Java process that runs in and is supported by the host

and efficiently a broker can route and deliver messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, the JVM&#8217;s management of memory resources can be critical.
Sufficient memory has to be allocated to the JVM to accommodate
increasing memory loads. In addition, the JVM periodically reclaims
unused memory, and this memory reclamation can delay message processing.
The larger the JVM memory heap, the longer the potential delay that
might be experienced during memory reclamation.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dedicated thread model is very fast because each connection has
dedicated threads, however the number of connections is limited by the
number of threads available (one input thread and one output thread for
each connection). The shared thread model places no limit on the number
of connections, however there is significant overhead and throughput
delays in sharing threads among a number of connections, especially when

<p>Message Queue software allows clients to communicate with the broker

<a href="connection-services.html#aeocn">Configuring Connection Services</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general we found that protocol has less effect in the
high-reliability case. This is probably because the persistence overhead
required in the high-reliability case is a more important factor in
limiting throughput than the protocol speed. Additionally:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TCP provides the fastest method to communicate with the broker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSL is 50 to 70 percent slower than TCP when it comes to sending and
receiving messages (50 percent for persistent messages, closer to 70
percent for nonpersistent messages). Additionally, establishing the
initial connection is slower with SSL (it might take several seconds)
because the client and broker (or Web Server in the case of HTTPS) need
to establish a private key to be used when encrypting the data for
transmission. The performance drop is caused by the additional
processing required to encrypt and decrypt each low-level TCP packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP is slower than either the TCP or SSL. It uses a servlet that runs
on a Web server as a proxy between the client and the broker.
Performance overhead is involved in encapsulating packets in HTTP
requests and in the requirement that messages go through two
hops&#8212;&#8203;client to servlet, servlet to broker&#8212;&#8203;to reach the broker.</p>

<p>A Message Queue message service can be implemented as a single broker or
as a cluster consisting of multiple interconnected broker instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the number of clients connected to a broker increases, and as the
number of messages being delivered increases, a broker will eventually
exceed resource limitations such as file descriptor, thread, and memory
limits. One way to accommodate increasing loads is to add more broker
instances to a Message Queue message service, distributing client
connections and message routing and delivery across multiple brokers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, this scaling works best if clients are evenly distributed
across the cluster, especially message producing clients. Because of the
overhead involved in delivering messages between the brokers in a
cluster, clusters with limited numbers of connections or limited message
delivery rates, might exhibit lower performance than a single broker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might also use a broker cluster to optimize network bandwidth. For
example, you might want to use slower, long distance network links
between a set of remote brokers within a cluster, while using higher
speed links for connecting clients to their respective broker instances.</p>

<p>The message throughput that a broker might be required to handle is a
function of the use patterns of the messaging applications the broker
supports. However, the broker is limited in resources: memory, CPU
cycles, and so forth. As a result, it would be possible for a broker to
become overwhelmed to the point where it becomes unresponsive or
unstable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Message Queue message broker has mechanisms built in for managing
memory resources and preventing the broker from running out of memory.
These mechanisms include configurable limits on the number of messages
or message bytes that can be held by a broker or its individual physical
destinations, and a set of behaviors that can be instituted when
physical destination limits are reached.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With careful monitoring and tuning, these configurable mechanisms can be
used to balance the inflow and outflow of messages so that system
overload cannot occur. While these mechanisms consume overhead and can
limit message throughput, they nevertheless maintain operational

persistent data. JDBC-based persistence uses a Java Database

File-based persistence is generally faster than JDBC-based; however,
some users prefer the redundancy and administrative control provided by
a JDBC-compliant store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the case of file-based persistence, you can maximize reliability by
specifying that persistence operations synchronize the in-memory state

<p>By default, the broker uses a JVM heap size of 192MB. This is often too
small for significant message loads and should be increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the broker gets close to exhausting the JVM heap space used by Java
objects, it uses various techniques such as flow control and message
swapping to free memory. Under extreme circumstances it even closes
client connections in order to free the memory and reduce the message
inflow. Hence it is desirable to set the maximum JVM heap space high
enough to avoid such circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if the maximum Java heap space is set too high, in relation to
system physical memory, the broker can continue to grow the Java heap
space until the entire system runs out of memory. This can result in
diminished performance, unpredictable broker crashes, and/or affect the
behavior of other applications and services running on the system. In
general, you need to allow enough physical memory for the operating
system and other applications to run on the machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general it is a good idea to evaluate the normal and peak system
memory footprints, and configure the Java heap size so that it is large
enough to provide good performance, but not so large as to risk system
memory problems.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To change the minimum and maximum heap size for the broker, use the

<p>Once a protocol that meets application needs has been chosen, additional
tuning (based on the selected protocol) might improve performance.</p>
</div>

<li>
<p><code>imq.protocol.`protocolType</code>.outbufsz`</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For TCP and SSL protocols, these properties affect the speed of message
delivery between client and broker. For HTTP and HTTPS protocols, these
properties affect the speed of message delivery between the Message
Queue tunnel servlet (running on a Web server) and the broker. For HTTP/
HTTPS protocols there are additional properties that can affect
performance (see <a href="#aeokr">HTTP/HTTPS Tuning</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The protocol tuning properties are described in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="aeokp"></a><a id="GMADG00093"></a><a id="nodelay"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>nodelay</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>nodelay</code> property affects Nagle&#8217;s algorithm (the value of the
<code>TCP_NODELAY</code> socket-level option on TCP/IP) for the given protocol.
Nagle&#8217;s algorithm is used to improve TCP performance on systems using
slow connections such as wide-area networks (WANs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the algorithm is used, TCP tries to prevent several small chunks of
data from being sent to the remote system (by bundling the data in
larger packets). If the data written to the socket does not fill the
required buffer size, the protocol delays sending the packet until
either the buffer is filled or a specific delay time has elapsed. Once
the buffer is full or the timeout has occurred, the packet is sent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most messaging applications, performance is best if there is no
delay in the sending of packets (Nagle&#8217;s algorithm is not enabled). This
is because most interactions between client and broker are
request/response interactions: the client sends a packet of data to the
broker and waits for a response. For example, typical interactions
include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a connection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a producer or consumer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a persistent message (the broker confirms receipt of the
message)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending a client acknowledgment in an <code>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> or
<code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> session (the broker confirms processing of the
acknowledgment)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these interactions, most packets are smaller than the buffer size.
This means that if Nagle&#8217;s algorithm is used, the broker delays several
milliseconds before sending a response to the consumer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Nagle&#8217;s algorithm may improve performance in situations where
connections are slow and broker responses are not required. This would
be the case where a client sends a nonpersistent message or where a
client acknowledgment is not confirmed by the broker
(<code>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> session).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="aeokq"></a><a id="GMADG00094"></a><a id="inbufszoutbufsz"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>inbufsz/outbufsz</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>inbufsz</code> property sets the size of the buffer on the input stream
reading data coming in from a socket. Similarly, <code>outbufsz</code> sets the
buffer size of the output stream used by the broker to write data to the
socket.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, both parameters should be set to values that are slightly
larger than the average packet being received or sent. A good rule of
thumb is to set these property values to the size of the average packet
plus 1 kilobyte (rounded to the nearest kilobyte). For example, if the
broker is receiving packets with a body size of 1 kilobyte, the overall
size of the packet (message body plus header plus properties) is about
1200 bytes; an <code>inbufsz</code> of 2 kilobytes (2048 bytes) gives reasonable
performance. Increasing <code>inbufsz</code> or <code>outbufsz</code> greater than that size
may improve performance slightly, but increases the memory needed for
each connection.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>HTTP/HTTPS Tuning</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the general properties discussed in the previous two
sections, HTTP/HTTPS performance is limited by how fast a client can
make HTTP requests to the Web server hosting the Message Queue tunnel
servlet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Web server might need to be optimized to handle multiple requests on a
single socket. With JDK version 1.4 and later, HTTP connections to a Web
server are kept alive (the socket to the Web server remains open) to
minimize resources used by the Web server when it processes multiple
HTTP requests. If the performance of a client application using JDK
version 1.4 is slower than the same application running with an earlier
JDK release, you might need to tune the Web server keep-alive
configuration parameters to improve performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to such Web server tuning, you can also adjust how often a
client polls the Web server. HTTP is a request-based protocol. This
means that clients using an HTTP-based protocol periodically need to
check the Web server to see if messages are waiting. The
<code>imq.httpjms.http.pullPeriod</code> broker property (and the corresponding
<code>imq.httpsjms.https.pullPeriod</code> property) specifies how often the
Message Queue client runtime polls the Web server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <code>pullPeriod</code> value is <code>-1</code> (the default value), the client
runtime polls the server as soon as the previous request returns,
maximizing the performance of the individual client. As a result, each
client connection monopolizes a request thread in the Web server,
possibly straining Web server resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <code>pullPeriod</code> value is a positive number, the client runtime
periodically sends requests to the Web server to see if there is pending
data. In this case, the client does not monopolize a request thread in
the Web server. Hence, if large numbers of clients are using the Web
server, you might conserve Web server resources by setting the
<code>pullPeriod</code> to a positive value.</p>

<p>If message producers tend to overrun message consumers, messages can
accumulate in the broker. The broker contains a mechanism for throttling
back producers and swapping messages out of active memory under low
memory conditions, but it is wise to set a hard limit on the total
number of messages (and message bytes) that the broker can hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Control these limits by setting the <code>imq.system.max_count</code> and the
<code>imq.system.max_size</code> broker properties.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>

<p>The defined value above means that the broker will only hold up to 5000
undelivered and/or unacknowledged messages. If additional messages are
sent, they are rejected by the broker. If a message is persistent then
the clinet runtime will throw an exception when the producer tries to
send the message. If the message is non-persistent, the broker silently
drops the message.</p>
</div>

<p>When an exception is thrown in sending a message, the client should
process the exception by pausing for a moment and retrying the send
again. (Note that the exception will never be due to the broker&#8217;s
failure to receive a message; the exception is thrown by the client
runtime before the message is sent to the broker.)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messages sent and received by clients (payload messages), as well as
Message Queue control messages, pass over the same client-broker
connection. Delays in the delivery of control messages, such as broker
acknowledgments, can result if control messages are held up by the
delivery of payload messages. To prevent this type of congestion,
Message Queue meters the flow of payload messages across a connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Payload messages are batched (as specified with the connection factory
attribute <code>imqConnectionFlowCount</code>) so that only a set number are
delivered. After the batch has been delivered, delivery of payload
messages is suspended and only pending control messages are delivered.
This cycle repeats, as additional batches of payload messages are
delivered followed by pending control messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The value of <code>imqConnectionFlowCount</code> should be kept low if the client
is doing operations that require many responses from the broker: for
example, if the client is using <code>CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> or
<code>AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode, persistent messages, transactions, or queue
browsers, or is adding or removing consumers. If, on the other hand, the
client has only simple consumers on a connection using
<code>DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE</code> mode, you can increase <code>imqConnectionFlowCount</code>
without compromising performance.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a limit to the number of payload messages that the Message
Queue client runtime can handle before encountering local resource
limitations, such as memory. When this limit is approached, performance
suffers. Hence, Message Queue lets you limit the number of messages per
consumer (or messages per connection) that can be delivered over a
connection and buffered in the client runtime, waiting to be consumed.</p>

<p>Consumer Flow Limits</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the number of payload messages delivered to the client runtime
exceeds the value of <code>imqConsumerFlowLimit</code> for any consumer, message
delivery for that consumer stops. It is resumed only when the number of
unconsumed messages for that consumer drops below the value set with
<code>imqConsumerFlowThreshold</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following example illustrates the use of these limits: consider the
default settings for topic consumers:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">imqConsumerFlowLimit=1000
imqConsumerFlowThreshold=50</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the consumer is created, the broker delivers an initial batch of
1000 messages (providing they exist) to this consumer without pausing.
After sending 1000 messages, the broker stops delivery until the client
runtime asks for more messages. The client runtime holds these messages
until the application processes them. The client runtime then allows the
application to consume at least 50% (<code>imqConsumerFlowThreshold</code> ) of the
message buffer capacity (i.e. 500 messages) before asking the broker to
send the next batch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same situation, if the threshold were 10%, the client runtime
would wait for the application to consume at least 900 messages before
asking for the next batch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next batch size is calculated as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-oac_no_warn" data-lang="oac_no_warn">imqConsumerFlowLimit - (current number of pending msgs in buffer)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if <code>imqConsumerFlowThreshold</code> is 50%, the next batch size can
fluctuate between 500 and 1000, depending on how fast the application
can process the messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <code>imqConsumerFlowThreshold</code> is set too high (close to 100%), the
broker will tend to send smaller batches, which can lower message
throughput. If the value is set too low (close to 0%), the client may be
able to finish processing the remaining buffered messages before the
broker delivers the next set, again degrading message throughput.
Generally speaking, unless you have specific performance or reliability
concerns, you will not need to change the default value of
<code>imqConsumerFlowThreshold</code> attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consumer-based flow controls (in particular, <code>imqConsumerFlowLimit</code>
) are the best way to manage memory in the client runtime. Generally,
depending on the client application, you know the number of consumers
you need to support on any connection, the size of the messages, and the
total amount of memory that is available to the client runtime.</p>

<p>In the case of some client applications, however, the number of

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connection-level flow controls limit the total number of messages
buffered for all consumers on a connection. If this number exceeds the
value of <code>imqConnectionFlowLimit</code>, delivery of messages through the

<p>The number of messages queued up in a session is a function of the
number of message consumers using the session and the message load for
each consumer. If a client is exhibiting delays in producing or
consuming messages, you can normally improve performance by redesigning
the application to distribute message producers and consumers among a
larger number of sessions or to distribute sessions among a larger
number of connections.</p>

<h4 id="_adjusting_multiple_consumer_queue_delivery">Adjusting Multiple-Consumer Queue Delivery</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The efficiency with which multiple queue consumers process messages in a
queue destination depends on a number of factors. To achieve optimal
message throughput there must be a sufficient number of consumers to
keep up with the rate of message production for the queue, and the
messages in the queue must be routed and then delivered to the active
consumers in such a way as to maximize their rate of consumption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The message delivery mechanism for multiple-consumer queues is that
messages are delivered to consumers in batches as each consumer is ready
to receive a new batch. The readiness of a consumer to receive a batch
of messages depends upon configurable client runtime properties, such as
<code>imqConsumerFlowLimit</code> and <code>imqConsumerFlowThreshold</code>, as described in
<a href="#aeola">Message Flow Limits</a>. As new consumers are added to a queue,
they are sent a batch of messages to consume, and receive subsequent
batches as they become ready.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If messages are accumulating in the queue, it is possible that there is
an insufficient number of consumers to handle the message load. It is
also possible that messages are being delivered to consumers in batch
sizes that cause messages to be backing up on the consumers. For
example, if the batch size (<code>consumerFlowLimit</code>) is too large, one
consumer might receive all the messages in a queue while other consumers
receive none. If consumers are very fast, this might not be a problem.
However, if consumers are relatively slow, you want messages to be
distributed to them evenly, and therefore you want the batch size to be
small. Although smaller batch sizes require more overhead to deliver
messages to consumers, for slow consumers there is generally a net
performance gain in using small batch sizes. The value of
<code>consumerFlowLimit</code> can be set on a destination as well as on the client
runtime: the smaller value overrides the larger one.</p>
