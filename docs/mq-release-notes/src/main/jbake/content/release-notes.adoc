About Message Queue 6.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue is a full-featured message service that provides reliable,
asynchronous messaging in conformance with the Jakarta Messaging.
Message Queue 6.7.0 conforms to Jakarta Messaging 3.1.
In addition, Message
Queue provides features that go beyond the JMS specification to meet the
needs of large-scale enterprise deployments.

Like previous release of Message Queue, the Message Queue 6.7.0
binary release does not include the C-API library although the C-API
source code is available at
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/openmq[]`https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/openmq`

[[aenav]][[GMRLN00017]][[message-queue-6.3-supported-platforms-and-components]]

Message Queue 6.3 Supported Platforms and Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section covers the following topics regarding Message Queue 6.3
system requirements:

* link:#ggrwc[Platform Support]
* link:#ggrvt[System Virtualization Support]
* link:#ggrwj[Optional Support Components]

[[ggrwc]][[GMRLN00069]][[platform-support]]

Platform Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a participant in the 8.0 release of GlassFish Server, Message Queue
6.5 supports the operating environments, databases, LDAP servers, and
hardware listed in the Eclipse GlassFish Server 8.0 Certification Matrix,
which is accessible at (`https://glassfish.org/`).

[[ggrvt]][[GMRLN00070]][[system-virtualization-support]]

System Virtualization Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System virtualization is a technology that enables multiple operating
system (OS) instances to execute independently on shared hardware.
Functionally, software deployed to an OS hosted in a virtualized
environment is generally unaware that the underlying platform has been
virtualized. Eclipse Foundation performs testing of its products on select system
virtualization and OS combinations to help validate that products
continue to function on properly sized and configured virtualized
environments as they do on non-virtualized systems.

[[ggrwj]][[GMRLN00071]][[optional-support-components]]

Optional Support Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the software components listed in the Eclipse GlassFish
Server 6.1 Certification Matrix, link:#gcuzg[Table 1-3] shows components
that you can install to provide additional support for Message Queue
clients.

[[GMRLN120]][[sthref6]][[gcuzg]]

[[CHDBGAHA]][[new-features-in-message-queue-5.1]]

New Features in Message Queue 5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue 5.1 provides support for the Java EE 7 release. It
includes new features, some feature enhancements, and bug fixes. This
section includes a description of new features in this releases:

[[sthref7]]

MQ JMS Client over WebSocket

MQ has traditionally supported HTTP Servlet Tunneling for MQ Java
clients to communicate with a message broker over HTTP/HTTPS transport
protocol. This new feature allows MQ JMS clients to communicate with MQ
broker over WebSocket transport. Please see details at
`https://javaee.github.io/openmq/www/5.0.1/ws.html`

[[sthref8]]

MQ STOMP Client over WebSocket

STOMP is a simple text streaming oriented messaging protocol which
provides interoperable wire format for any STOMP client to communicate
with a STOMP messaging broker. MQ broker has provided STOMP messaging
service via the 'stomp' bridge, which supports STOMP on TCP or SSL
transport. This new feature allows STOMP clients communicate to MQ
broker over WebSocket. Please see details at
`https://javaee.github.io/openmq/www/5.0.1/ws.html`

[[CHDIACCI]][[installation]]

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue 6.1 is installed as a sub-directory of the GlassFish 6.1
installation. For installation information, see the
https://glassfish.org/docs/latest/installation-guide/toc.html[Eclipse GlassFish
Server Installation Guide].

[[aemaq]][[GMRLN00021]][[compatibility-considerations]]

Compatibility Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section covers compatibility considerations when using Message
Queue.

* Message Queue 6.5 must be used with Java SE 11+. This general JMS 3.1
and Jakarta EE 11 requirement implies that whenever Message Queue 6.5 jars
are used in your classpath, you must use Java 11+. For information on how
to set the Java runtime for a broker, see "Using an "Alternative Java
Runtime" in the Open Message Queue Administration Guide.
* Message Queue 6.5 brokers now use the Java `java.util.logging` logger.
* Message Queue uses many interfaces that may change over time.
Scalability of Message Queue Interfaces in
https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/openmq/guides/mq-admin-guide/toc.html[Open
Message Queue Administration Guide] classifies the interfaces according
to their stability. The more stable an interface, the less likely it is
to change in subsequent versions of the product.
* HADB database is no longer supported since the Message Queue 5.1 release.

[[ggsjx]][[GMRLN00020]][[features-to-be-deprecated-in-a-future-release]]

Features to be Deprecated in a Future Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features will be deprecated in a future release:

* Message-based monitoring +
Message-based monitoring makes use of the broker's configurable Metrics
Message Producer to write metrics data into JMS messages, which are then
sent to metrics topic destinations, depending on the type of metrics
information contained in the messages. This metrics information can then
be accessed by writing a client application that subscribes to the
appropriate metrics topic destination, consumes its messages, and
processes the data as desired. +
The message-based monitoring feature has been supplanted by the
Administration API that was introduced in MQ 4.0 (see
link:#ggltn[Support for JMX Administration API]). The JMX API is more
comprehensive (it includes more metrics data than is written to topic
destinations) and is based on the JMX industry standard. +
There is no compelling reason to use message-based monitoring now that
Message Queue supports the JMX API. Information about message-based
monitoring will remain in the Message Queue JMX until the feature is
formally deprecated.
* Clear Text Passfile +
Using a clear text passfile is not recommended and support will be
removed in a future release. Oracle recommends existing plain text
passfiles be obfuscated by running `imqusermgr encode`. See
link:../mq-admin-guide/security-services.html#GMADG00250["Password Files"] in the Open Message Queue
Administration Guide.

[[aembi]][[GMRLN00022]][[known-issues-and-limitations]]

Known Issues and Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains a list of the known issues with Message Queue 5.1.
The following product areas are covered:

* link:#gcblj[Deprecated Password Option]
* link:#CHDFBIFH[Administration/Configuration Issues]
* link:#aembn[Broker Issues]
* link:#aembl[Broker Clusters]
* link:#gfbsc[SOAP Support]

For a list of current bugs, their status, and workarounds, see the
https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/issues[OpenMQ Issues.] Please check
that page before you report a new bug. Although all Message Queue bugs
are not listed, the page is a good starting place if you want to know
whether a problem has been reported.

To report a new bug or submit a feature request, please file an issue at
`https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/openmq/`.

[[gcblj]][[GMRLN00075]][[deprecated-password-option]]

Deprecated Password Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In previous versions of Message Queue, you could use the `—p` or
`—password` option to specify a password interactively for the following
commands: `imqcmd`, `imqbrokerd`, and `imdbmgr`. Beginning with version
4.0, these options have been deprecated.

Instead, you can create a password file that specifies the relevant
passwords and reference the password file using the `-passfile` command
option, or simply enter a password when prompted by the command.

A password file can contain one or more of the passwords listed below.

* A keystore password used to open the SSL keystore. Use the
`imq.keystore.password` property to specify this password.
* An LDAP repository password used to connect securely with an LDAP
directory if the connection is not anonymous. Use the
`imq.user_repository.ldap.password` property to specify this password.
* A JDBC database password used to connect to a JDBC-compliant database.
Use the `imq.persist.jdbc.vendorName.password` property to specify this
password. The vendorName component of the property name is a variable
that specifies the database vendor. Choices include `hadb`, `derby`,
`pointbase`, `oracle`, or `mysql`.
* A password to the `imqcmd` command (to perform broker administration
tasks). Use the `imq.imqcmd.password` property to specify this password.

In the following example, the password to the JDBC database is set in
the password file to `abracadabra.`

`imq.persist.jdbc.mysql.password=abracadabra`

You can use a password file in one of the following ways.

* Configure the broker to use the password file by setting the following
properties in the broker's `config.properties` file. +
`imq.passfile.enabled=true``imq.passfile.dirpath=`passwordFileDirectory`imq.passfile.name=`passwordFileName
* Use the `-passfile` option of the relevant command, for example: +
`imqbrokerd -passfile` passwordFileName

[[CHDFBIFH]][[administrationconfiguration-issues]]

Administration/Configuration Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following issues pertain to administration and configuration of
Message Queue.

* On Windows platforms, you need to manually add the Message Queue
broker as a Windows service using the `imqsvcadm` command. The installer
does not do this for you.
* On Windows platforms, the built-in Windows Firewall, which is enabled
by default, must be manually configured with a firewall rule that allows
the broker to accept incoming connections from clients. (Bug 6675595)
1.  Double-click on Windows Firewall in the Control Panel +
You will have to click Continue on the User Account Control dialog for
the Windows Firewall Settings dialog to open.
2.  In the Windows Firewall Settings dialog, click the Exceptions tab.
3.  Click Add program.
4.  In the Add a Program dialog, select `java.exe` and click Browse. +
Windows identifies the broker process as a Java Platform SE binary.
Therefore, locate the `java.exe` used by the broker.
5.  Click Change scope.
6.  In the Change Scope dialog, select "Any computer (including those on
the Internet."
7.  Click OK.
8.  In the Add a Program dialog, click OK.
9.  In the Windows Firewall Settings dialog, click OK.
* On Windows platforms, the `imqadmin` and `imqobjmgr` commands throw an
error when the `CLASSPATH` contains double quotes. (Bug 5060769) +
Workaround: Open a command prompt window and unset the `CLASSPATH`: +
`set classpath=` +
Then run the desired command the same command prompt window, for
example: +
mqInstallHome`\mq\bin\imqadmin`
* The `-javahome` option in all Solaris and Windows scripts does not
work if the value provided contains a space. (Bug 4683029) +
The `javahome` option is used by Message Queue commands and utilities to
specify an alternate Java compatible runtime to use. However, the path
name to the alternate Java runtime must not contain spaces. The
following are examples of paths that include spaces. +
Windows: `C:\jdk 1.8` +
Solaris: `/work/java 1.8` +
Workaround: Install the Java runtime at a location or path that does not
contain spaces.
* The `imqQueueBrowserMaxMessagesPerRetrieve` attribute specifies the
maximum number of messages that the client runtime retrieves at one time
when browsing the contents of a queue. The attribute affects how the
queued messages are batched, to be delivered to the client runtime, but
it does not affect the total number of messages browsed. The attribute
only affects the browsing mechanism, it does not affect queue message
delivery. (Bug 6387631)
* On Linux platform running SELinux, the Update Center `pkg` command
fails (Bug 6892062) +
Workaround: This issue is caused by a known issue in Update Center
UPDATECENTER2-1211 (. Use the following command to enable `pkg` to
function on SELinux with enforcement enabled: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
# chcon -f -t textrel_shlib_t $IMAGE/pkg/vendor-packages/OpenSSL/crypto.so
----

[[aembn]][[GMRLN00077]][[broker-issues]]

Broker Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* When a JMS client using the HTTP connection service terminates
abruptly (for example, using `Ctrl-C`) the broker takes approximately
one minute before releasing the client connection and all the associated
resources. +
If another instance of the client is started within the one minute
period and if it tries to use the same ClientID, durable subscription,
or queue, it might receive a "Client ID is already in use" exception.
This is not a real problem; it is just the side effect of the
termination process described above. If the client is started after a
delay of approximately one minute, everything should work fine.

[[aembl]][[GMRLN00078]][[broker-clusters]]

Broker Clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A client can only browse the contents of queues that are located on
its home broker. The client can still send messages to any queue or
consume messages from any queue in the cluster; the limitation only
affects queue browsing.
* In a conventional cluster that includes version 4.3 brokers, all
brokers must be version 3.5 or later.
* When converting from a conventional cluster to an enhanced cluster,
you can use the Message Queue Database Manager utility (`imqdbmgr`) to
convert an existing standalone JDBC-based data store to a shared JDBC
data store as documented in
"https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/openmq/guides/mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#ghshc[Cluster
Conversion: JDBC-Based Data Store]" in Open Message Queue Administration
Guide.

[[gfbsc]][[GMRLN00080]][[soap-support]]

SOAP Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to be aware of two issues related to SOAP support

* Beginning with the release of version 4.0 of Message Queue, support
for SOAP administered objects is discontinued.
* SOAP development depends upon several files: `SUNWjaf`, `SUNWjmail`,
`SUNWxsrt`, and `SUNWjaxp`. In version 4.1 of Message Queue, these files
are available to you only if you are running Message Queue with JDK
version 1.6.0 or later.
* Previously the SAAJ 1.2 implementation .jar directly referenced
`mail.jar`. In SAAJ 1.3 this reference was removed; thus, Message Queue
clients must explicitly put `mail.jar` in `CLASSPATH`.

New Features in Previous Message Queue 5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue 5.0 is a minor release providing support for the Java
Messaging Specification (JMS), version 2.0 and the Java EE 7 release. It
included a few new features, some feature enhancements, and bug fixes.
This section includes a description of new features in this releases:

[[GMRLN122]][[sthref11]]


[[support-for-jms-2.0-features-and-enhancements]]
Support for JMS 2.0 Features and Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue 5.0 implements the JMS 2.0 API. This introduces a
completely new Simplified API that makes JMS much simpler and easier to
use. The existing Classic API remains and a number of improvements have
been made to make the Classic API simpler and easier to use as well. For
more information, see link:../mq-dev-guide-java/using-the-simplifed-java-api.html#GMJVG344["The JMS Simplified API"] in Open
Message Queue Developer's Guide for Java Clients.

Other changes introduced into JMS 2.0 include:

* Designating a topic subscription as being shared, which allows it to
have more than one consumer. Setting `clientId` is optional for shared
subscriptions.
* A new method `getBody` has been added to `Message` which allows the
message body to be extracted without the need to cast to a particular
subtype.
* A new method, `setDeliveryDelay`, has been added to `MessageProducer`
which allows a delivery delay to be specified. A message will not be
delivered to a consumer until after the specified delay has elapsed.
* New send methods have been added to `MessageProducer` which allow
messages to be sent asynchronously. These methods permit the JMS
provider to perform part of the work involved in sending the message in
a separate thread. When the send is complete, a callback method is
invoked on an object supplied by the caller.
* The `Connection`, `Session`, `MessageProducer`, `MessageConsumer` and
`QueueBrowser` interfaces have been modified to extend the
`java.lang.Autocloseable` interface. This means that applications can
create these objects using a Java SE 7 `try-with-resources` statement
which removes the need for applications to explicitly call `close()`
when these objects are no longer required.
* The existing standard message property `JMSXDeliveryCount` has been
made mandatory. It was previously optional. This means that Message
Queue will now always set this property to the number of times the
message has been delivered.

[[GMRLN123]][[sthref12]]


[[additional-message-queue-5.0-enhancements]]
Additional Message Queue 5.0 Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release of Message Queue also includes the following changes and
enhancements:

* Previously, the `JMXDeliveryCount` was used as a property to track the
number of times a message was delivered to a given consumer before being
placed on the DMQ. To conform to the JMS 2.0 specification, this Message
Queue release introduces `JMS_SUN_DMQ_DELIVERY_COUNT` as a new property
for that purpose.
* A new connection factory property,
`imqAsyncSendCompletionWaitTimeout`, sets the amount of time, in
milliseconds, that a MQ client waits for an asynchronous send to
complete before calling `CompletionListener.onException`.
* The shared `threadpool_model` for a connection service that was used
in previous releases has been replaced by a new implementation and the
shared t`hreadpool_model` is now able to support `tls` protocoltype.
* A new administrative interface to provide the ability to obfuscate
passwords in a `passfile` for Message Queue broker command line
utilities. See link:../mq-admin-guide/security-services.html#GMADG00250["Password Files"] in the Open Message
Queue Administration Guide.
* Support for DB reconnect in the Message Queue JDBC Connection Pool.
See link:../mq-admin-guide/persistence-services.html#GMADG00244["JDBC-Based Persistence"] and olink:GMADG00174["To
Connect Brokers Using a Cluster Configuration File"] in the Open Message
Queue Administration Guide.
* The following C API functions are added this release to support shared
durable subscribers:

** `MQCreateSharedDurableMessageConsumer`

** `MQCreateSharedMessageConsumer`

** `MQCreateAsyncSharedDurableMessageConsumer`

** `MQCreateAsyncSharedMessageConsumer` +
See link:../mq-dev-guide-c/reference.html#GMCCG00005["Reference"] in the Open Message Queue Developer's

New Features in Message Queue 4.5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue 4.5 is an incremental release that includes a number of
feature enhancements and bug fixes. Two of the most important features
in this release relate to broker clusters, and another relates to
consumer event notifications for Java clients:

Conventional clusters of peer brokers::
  This release introduces a new type of conventional cluster, the
  conventional cluster of peer brokers. Unlike a conventional cluster
  with a master broker, a conventional cluster of peer brokers maintains
  the cluster configuration change record in a shared JDBC data store
  instead of in the master broker. Thus, brokers can access cluster
  configuration information whether any other brokers in the cluster are
  running or not. For more information about conventional clusters of
  peer brokers, see "link:../mq-tech-over/broker-clusters.html#GMTOV00028[Broker Clusters]" in Open Message
  Queue Technical Overview. For information about configuring and
  managing conventional clusters of peer brokers, see
  "link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00041[Configuring and Managing Broker Clusters]" in Open
  Message Queue Administration Guide.
Dynamically changing the master broker::
  Previously, to change the master broker in a conventional cluster from
  one broker to another, you had to stop all brokers, manually migrate
  the cluster configuration change record from the old master broker to
  the new one, and then start all brokers. This release provides the
  ability to change the master broker dynamically without stopping the
  cluster or performing manual migration tasks. For more information,
  see "link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00420[Changing the Master Broker in a Conventional
  Cluster with Master Broker]" in Open Message Queue Administration
  Guide.
Consumer event notifications for Java clients::
  This release introduces consumer event notifications for Java clients,
  which allow a Java client to listen for the existence of consumers on
  a destination. Thus, for example, a producer client can start or stop
  producing messages to a given destination based on the existence of
  consumers on the destination. For more information, see
  "link:../mq-dev-guide-java/client-design-and-features.html#GMJVG00103[Consumer Event Notification]" in Open Message Queue
  Developer's Guide for Java Clients.

[[gktmu]][[GMRLN00082]][[new-features-in-message-queue-4.4.2]]

New Features in Message Queue 4.4.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue 4.4.2 is a minor release that includes a number of feature
enhancements and bug fixes. This section describes the new features
included in this release.

* Message Queue now supports literal IPv6 addresses as broker host names
when the hostname:port format is used. Previously, literal IPv6
addresses were only supported for the hostname format. If you use a
literal IPv6 address, its format must conform to
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt[RFC2732]
(`http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt`), Format for Literal IPv6
Addresses in URL's.
* To address situations related to failover and restart of brokers in
enhanced clusters, these features have been added:

** The `-reset takeover-then-exit` option of the `imqbrokerd` command

** The `imq.cluster.ha.takeoverWaitTimeout` broker property
* To provide more configurable control of connections to a JDBC data
store, these broker properties have been added:

** `imq.persist.jdbc.connection.timeoutIdle`

** `imq.persist.jdbc.connection.validateOnGet`

** `imq.persist.jdbc.connection.validationQuery`
* To control generation of informational log messages about successful
message transfers across a JMS bridge, the `log-message-transfer`
attribute has been added to the `jmsbridge` element in the XML
configuration file for a JMS bridge.
* To enable the STOMP bridge service to bind to a specific network
interface, the `imq.bridge.stomp.hostname` broker property has been
added.

[[gired]][[GMRLN00084]][[new-features-in-message-queue-4.4]]

New Features in Message Queue 4.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue 4.4 is a minor release that includes a number of feature
enhancements and bug fixes. This section describes the new features
included in this release:

* link:#gjdmj[JMS Bridge Service]
* link:#gjdnz[STOMP Bridge Service]
* link:#gjdko[Additional Enhancements]

[[gjdmj]][[GMRLN00039]][[jms-bridge-service]]

JMS Bridge Service
++++++++++++++++++

Because the JMS specification does not define a wire protocol for
communication between brokers and clients, each JMS provider (including
Message Queue) has defined and uses its own propriety protocol. This
situation has led to non-interoperability across JMS providers.

The JMS bridge service in Message Queue 4.4 closes this gap by enabling
a Message Queue broker to map its destinations to destinations in
external JMS providers. This mapping effectively allows the Message
Queue broker to communicate with clients of the external JMS provider.

The JMS bridge service supports mapping destinations in external JMS
providers that:

* Are JMS 1.1 compliant
* Support JNDI administrative objects
* Use connection factories of type `jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory` or
`jakarta.jms.XAConnectionFactory`
* For transacted mapping, support the XA interfaces as a resource
manager

Many open source and commercial JMS providers meet these requirements,
which makes the JMS bridge service an effective way to integrate Message
Queue into an existing messaging environment that employs other JMS
providers.

For more information about the JMS bridge service see
"link:../mq-admin-guide/bridge-services.html#GMADG00259[Configuring and Managing JMS Bridge Services]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide.

[[gjdnz]][[GMRLN00040]][[stomp-bridge-service]]

STOMP Bridge Service
++++++++++++++++++++

As mentioned earlier, the JMS specification does not define a wire
protocol for communication between brokers and clients. The STOMP
(Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) open source project at
`http://docs.codehaus.org/display/STOMP` defines a simple wire protocol
that clients written in any language can use to communicate with any
messaging provider that supports the STOMP protocol.

Message Queue 4.4 provides support for the STOMP protocol through the
STOMP bridge service. This service enables a Message Queue broker
communicate with STOMP clients.

For more information about the STOMP bridge service see
"link:../mq-admin-guide/bridge-services.html#GMADG00260[Configuring and Managing STOMP Bridge Services]" in
Open Message Queue Administration Guide.

[[gjdko]][[GMRLN00041]][[additional-enhancements]]

Additional Enhancements

The following additional enhancements are also provided in Message Queue
4.4:

* link:#gjdlu[New Universal Message Service (UMS) Functions]
* link:#gjdke[IPS Package Support]
* link:#gjjze[Audit Logging Feature Reinstated]

[[gjdlu]][[GMRLN00005]][[new-universal-message-service-ums-functions]]

New Universal Message Service (UMS) Functions

The UMS now provides functions that use HTTP GET to offer several
services:

* getBrokerInfo: retrieves information about the broker.
* getConfiguration: retrieves information about the UMS configuration.
* debug: turns debug logging in the UMS server on and off.
* ping: communicates with the broker to confirm that it is running.

[[gjdke]][[GMRLN00006]][[ips-package-support]]

IPS Package Support

Message Queue is now packaged for distribution using the open source
Image Packaging System (IPS), also known as the `pkg(5)` system. This
packaging method has been added in order for Message Queue to integrate
with Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server 2.1.1.

[[gjjze]][[GMRLN00007]][[audit-logging-feature-reinstated]]

[[ghlkj]][[GMRLN00085]][[new-features-in-message-queue-4.3]]

New Features in Message Queue 4.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue 4.3 was a minor release that included a number of feature
enhancements and bug fixes. This section describes the new features
included in this release:

* link:#ghlir[Universal Message Service (UMS)]
* link:#ghlll[AIX Platform Support]
* link:#ghlla[New Zip-Based Installer]
* link:#ghllg[Extended Platform Support]
* link:#ghvdy[Additional Enhancements]

[[ghlir]][[GMRLN00042]][[universal-message-service-ums]]

Universal Message Service (UMS)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.3 introduces a new universal messaging service (UMS) and
messaging API that provides access to Message Queue from any
http-enabled device. As a result, almost any application can communicate
with any other application and benefit from the reliability and
guaranteed delivery of JMS messaging. In addition, the UMS provides
enhanced scalability for JMS messaging, allowing the number of messaging
clients to reach internet-scale proportions.

[[ghvaq]][[GMRLN00008]][[architecture]]

Architecture

The basic UMS architecture is shown in the following figure:

[[GMRLN00001]][[ghllf]]


.*Figure 1-1 UMS Architecture*
image:img/umsarchitecture.png[
"Illustration showing that the UMS as a gateway between Non-JMS clients
and a JMS provider."]


The UMS, which runs in a web server, is language neutral and platform
independent. The UMS serves as a gateway between any non-JMS client
application and a JMS provider. It receives messages sent using the UMS
API, transforms them into JMS messages, and produces them as persistent
messages to destinations in the JMS provider by way of the provider's
native protocol. Similarly, it retrieves messages from destinations in
the JMS provider in a transacted session using AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE mode,
transforms them into text or SOAP messages, and sends the messages to
non-JMS clients as requested by the clients through the UMS API.

The simple, language-independent, protocol-based UMS API supports both
Web-based and non-Web-based applications, and can be used with both
scripting and programming languages. The API is offered in two styles: a
simple messaging API that uses a Representational State Transfer
(REST)-style protocol, and an XML messaging API that embeds the protocol
in a SOAP message header. In both cases, however, the API requires only
a single http request to send or receive a message.

The simplicity and flexibility of the UMS API means that AJAX, .NET,
Python, C, Java, and many other applications can send text message
and/or SOAP (with attachment) messages to JMS destinations or receive
messages from JMS destinations. For example, Python applications can
communicate with .NET applications, iPhone can communicate with Java
applications, and so forth.

For Message Queue 4.3, the UMS supports only Message Queue as a JMS
provider.

[[ghvdj]][[GMRLN00009]][[additional-features]]

Additional Features

The UMS serves as more than the simple gateway described above. It
supports stateful as well as stateless client sessions. If requested by
the client, the UMS will maintain session state for the client
application across multiple service requests. The UMS can use
container-managed authentication, or be configured to authenticate
clients with the Message Queue broker, or both. The UMS also supports
transactions, enabling client applications to commit or roll back
multiple service requests as a single atomic unit.

Because the UMS can support a large number of clients on a single
connection to the Message Queue broker, it eases the load on the
broker's connection services, allowing for maximum scalability. In
addition, UMS capacity can be increased by horizontal scaling, allowing
for internet-scale messaging loads.

On the client side, because of the simplicity of the protocol-based UMS
API, no client libraries are required. As a result, the API can be
extended in the future to implement additional JMS features without any
need to upgrade client applications.

[[ghvda]][[GMRLN00010]][[using-the-ums]]

Using the UMS

To use the UMS, you deploy the UMS into a web container that supports
Servlet 2.4 or later specifications, start the Message Queue broker,
create the appropriate destinations, and write a messaging application
that uses the UMS API to send or receive messages.

The UMS `imqums.war` file, contained in the Message Queue 4.3
distribution, is installed in the following location, depending on
platform:

You can rename the `.war` file as appropriate.

After you have deployed the `imqums.war` into a web container at
`localhost:`port, you can find UMS at:

`http://localhost:`port`/imqums`

Otherwise you can find UMS as follows:

* For information on configuring the UMS, see
`http://mq.java.net/4.4-content/imqums/config.html`.
* For of the UMS API, see
`http://mq.java.net/4.4-content/imqums/protocol.html`.
* For programming examples in several languages, see
`http://mq.java.net/4.4-content/imqums/examples/README.html`.

[[GMRLN127]][[sthref14]]


[[supported-web-containers]]
Supported Web Containers

UMS is currently supported on the following web containers:

* Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server, Version 2.1 and Version 3 Prelude
* Tomcat, Versions 5.5 and 6.0

[[ghlll]][[GMRLN00043]][[aix-platform-support]]

AIX Platform Support
++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.3 provides AIX platform packages and an Installer for
installing them).

The Message Queue AIX implementation supports the following software:

* AIX v 6.1 or higher (earlier versions of AIX are supported via the
Unix/Java Only bundle)
* DB2 support
* IBM XL C/C++ Compiler V9.0
* JDK 1.5 or better

For installation instructions, see AIX Installation in Sun Java System
Message Queue 4.3 Installation Guide.

On the AIX platform, Message Queue files are installed under a single
Message Queue home directory, `IMQ_HOME`. `IMQ_HOME` denotes the
directory mqInstallHome`/mq`, where mqInstallHome is the installation
home directory you specify when installing the product (by default,
home-directory`/MessageQueue`).

The resulting Message Queue directory structure is the same as that for
the Windows platform (see the Windows section of
"link:../mq-admin-guide/data-locations.html#GMADG00054[Distribution-Specific Locations of Message Queue
Data]" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide.)

Message Queue support for the AIX platform includes support for the
Message Queue C-API. For instructions on building and compiling C
applications on the AIX platform, see XREF.

[[ghlla]][[GMRLN00044]][[new-zip-based-installer]]

New Zip-Based Installer
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.3 introduces a new installer for Zip-based
distributions, as opposed to native package distributions. The installer
is used to install the new Message Queue .zip distributions for the AIX
platform.

The new installer extracts Message Queue `.zip` files to any directory
for which you have write access (you do not need root privileges) and it
also enables you to register your Message Queue installation with Sun
Connection.

To minimize the size of download bundles, the Java Runtime is no longer
be included in the zip-based distribution (most sites will already have
it). As a result, the `installer` command requires that a JDK or JRE be
specified, either by using the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable or by
using the `-j` option on the command line, as follows:

`$ installer -j` JDK/JRE-path

where JDK/JRE-path is the path of the specified JDK or JRE.

[[ghllg]][[GMRLN00045]][[extended-platform-support]]

Extended Platform Support

New Directory Structure on Windows Platform

The installed directory structure for Message Queue on the Windows
platform has been modified from previous versions to match that of the
AIX platform. This directory structure will be adopted as well by the
Solaris and Linux platforms in the future, to facilitate multiple
installations on single computer and automatic update of Message Queue

[[gglfu]][[GMRLN00047]][[multiple-destinations-for-a-publisher-or-subscriber]]

Multiple Destinations for a Publisher or Subscriber
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With Message Queue 4.2, a publisher can publish messages to multiple
topic destinations and a subscriber can consume messages from multiple
topic destinations. This capability is achieved by using a topic
destination name that includes wildcard characters, representing
multiple destinations. Using such symbolic names allows administrators
to create additional topic destinations, as needed, consistent with the
wildcard naming scheme. Publishers and subscribers automatically publish
to and consume from the added destinations. (Wildcard topic subscribers
are more common than publishers.)


[NOTE]
=================================================

This feature does not apply to queue destinations.

=================================================


The format of symbolic topic destination names and examples of their use
is described in "link:../mq-admin-guide/message-delivery.html#GMADG00069[Supported Topic Destination Names]" in
Open Message Queue Administration Guide.

[[gjkas]][[GMRLN00048]][[schema-validation-of-xml-payload-messages]]

Schema Validation of XML Payload Messages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This feature, introduced in Message Queue 4.2, enables validation of the
content of a text (not object) XML message against an XML schema at the
point the message is sent to the broker. The location of the XML schema
(XSD) is specified as a property of a Message Queue destination. If no
XSD location is specified, the DTD declaration within the XML document
is used to perform DTD validation. (XSD validation, which includes data
type and value range validation, is more rigorous than DTD validation.)

For information on the use of this feature, see "link:../mq-dev-guide-java/client-design-and-features.html#GMJVG00106[Schema
Validation of XML Payload Messages]" in Open Message Queue Developer's
Guide for Java Clients.

[[gglha]][[GMRLN00049]][[c-api-support-for-distributed-transactions]]

C-API Support for Distributed Transactions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

According to the X/Open distributed transaction model, support for
distributed transactions relies upon a distributed transaction manager
which tracks and manages operations performed by one or more resource
managers. With Message Queue 4.2, the Message Queue C-API supports the
XA interface (between a distributed transaction manager and Message
Queue as a XA-compliant resource manager), allowing Message Queue C-API
clients running in a distributed transaction processing environment
(such as BEA Tuxedo) to participate in distributed transactions.

This distributed transaction support consists of the following new C-API
functions (and new parameters and error codes) used to implement the XA
interface specification:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
MQGetXAConnection()
MQCreateXASession()
----

If a C-client application is to be used in the context of a distributed
transaction, then it must obtain a connection by using
MQGetXAConnection() and create a session for producing and consuming
messages by using MQCreateXASession(). The start, commit, and rollback,
of any distributed transaction is managed through APIs provided by the
distributed transaction manager.

For details of using the distributed transaction functions, see
"link:../mq-dev-guide-c/using-the-c-api.html#GMCCG00045[Working With Distributed Transactions]" in Open
Message Queue Developer's Guide for C Clients.

Message Queue 4.2 provides programming examples based on the Tuxedo
transaction manager. For information on the use of these sample
programs, see "link:../mq-dev-guide-c/introduction.html#GMCCG00307[Distributed Transaction Sample
Programs]" in Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for C Clients.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The distributed transaction functionality is supported on Solaris,
Linux, and Windows platforms, however, to date it has only been
certified on the Solaris platform.

=======================================================================

you track, organize, and maintain Sun hardware and software.

As part of Message Queue installation, you can choose to register
Message Queue with Sun Connection. Information about the installed
Message Queue, such as the release version, host name, operating system,
installation date, and other such basic information is securely
transmitted to the Sun Connection database. The Sun Connection inventory
service can help you organize your Sun hardware and software, while the
update service can inform you of the latest available security fixes,
recommended updates, and feature enhancements.

For details of registering Message Queue with Sun Connection, see Sun
Java System Message Queue 4.3 Installation Guide.

Support for MySQL Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.2 introduced support for MySQL database as a JDBC-based
data store. MySQL Cluster Edition can be used as a JDBC database for a
standalone broker, and MySQL Cluster Edition can be used as the
highly-available shared data store needed for an enhanced broker
cluster. For information on configuring Message Queue to use MySQL, see
"link:../mq-admin-guide/persistence-services.html#GMADG00544[Configuring a JDBC-Based Data Store]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide and also "link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00416[Enhanced Broker
Cluster Properties]" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide.

[[ghlpr]][[GMRLN00052]][[additional-enhancements-2]]

Additional Enhancements
+++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to the features described above, Message Queue 4.2 included
the following enhancements:

* Remotely Produced Message Metrics +
Message Queue 4.2 introduced new destination metrics that can be useful
in monitoring destinations in a broker cluster. In a broker cluster, the
messages stored in a given destination on a given broker in the cluster,
consist of messages produced directly to the destination as well as
messages sent to the destination from remote brokers in the cluster. In
analyzing message routing and delivery in a broker cluster, it is
sometimes helpful to know how many messages in a destination are local
(locally produced) and how many are remote (remotely produced). +
Two new physical destination metric quantities are included in Message
Queue 4.2:

** `Num messages remote`, the current number of messages stored in
memory and persistent store that were produced to a remote broker in a
cluster, except for messages included in transactions.

** `Total Message bytes remote`, the current total size in bytes of
messages stored in memory and persistent store that were produced to a
remote broker in a cluster, except for messages included in
transactions. +
These new metric quantities are available through the `imqcmd list dst`
and `imqcmd query dst` commands (see "link:../mq-admin-guide/message-delivery.html#GMADG00536[Viewing Physical
Destination Information]" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide)
and through new JMX attributes (see "link:../mq-dev-guide-jmx/mbean-reference.html#GMJMG00185[Destination
Monitor]" in Open Message Queue Developer's Guide for JMX Clients).
* Wildcard Producer and Wildcard Consumer Information +
Information to support the use of wildcard characters in destination
names (see link:#gglfu[Multiple Destinations for a Publisher or
Subscriber]) is provided through new monitoring data. For example, the
number of wildcard producers or consumers associated with a destination
are available through the `imqcmd query dst` command (see
"link:../mq-admin-guide/message-delivery.html#GMADG00536[Viewing Physical Destination Information]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide) and through new JMX attributes (see
"link:../mq-dev-guide-jmx/mbean-reference.html#GMJMG00185[Destination Monitor]" in Open Message Queue
Developer's Guide for JMX Clients). Also, wildcard information is
available through the `ConsumerManager Monitor` and
`ProducerManager Monitor` MBeans.
* Support for DN Username Format for Client Authentication +
Message Queue 4.2 introduced support for DN username format in client
connection authentication against an LDAP user repository. The support
involves the following new broker property (and value): +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.usrformat=dn` +
This property lets the broker authenticate a client user against an
entry in an LDAP user repository by extracting from the DN username
format the value of the attribute specified by the following property: +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.uidattr` +
The broker uses the value of the above attribute as the name of the user
in access control operations. +
For example, if `imq.user_repository.ldap.uidattr=udi` and a client
authentication username is in the format
`udi=mquser,ou=People,dc=red,dc=sun,dc=com`, then "mquser" would be
extracted for performing access control.
* JAAS Authentication Enhancement +
Message Queue 4.2 introduced JAAS authentication by IP address as well
as by username.

[[ggltx]][[GMRLN00053]][[high-availability-broker-clusters]]

High-Availability Broker Clusters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.1 introduced a new, enhanced broker cluster. As compared
to a conventional broker cluster, which provides only messaging service
availability (if a broker fails, another broker is available to provide
messaging service), the enhanced broker cluster also provides data
availability (if a broker fails, its persistent messages and state data
are available to another broker to use to take over message delivery).

The high-availability implementation introduced in Message Queue 4.1
uses a shared JDBC-based data store: instead of each broker in a broker
cluster having its own persistent data store, all brokers in the cluster
share the same JDBC-compliant database. If a particular broker fails,
another broker within the cluster takes over message delivery for the
failed broker. In doing so, the failover broker uses data and state
information in the shared data store. Messaging clients of the failed
broker reconnect to the failover broker, which provides uninterrupted
messaging service.

The shared JDBC-based store used in the Message Queue 4.1
high-availability implementation must itself be highly available. If you
do not have a highly available database or if uninterrupted message
delivery is not important to you, you can continue to use conventional
clusters, which provide service availability without data availability.

To configure a Message Queue 4.1 enhanced broker cluster, you specify
the following broker properties for each broker in the cluster:

* Cluster membership properties, which specify that the broker is in an
enhanced broker cluster, the ID of the cluster, and the ID of the broker
within the cluster.
* Highly available database properties, which specify the persistent
data model (JDBC), the name of the database vendor, and vendor-specific
configuration properties.
* Failure detection and failover properties, which specify how broker
failure is detected and handled using a failover broker.

To use the enhanced broker cluster implementation, you must do the
following:

1.  Install a highly available database.
2.  Install the JDBC driver .jar file.
3.  Create the database schema for the highly available persistent data
store.
4.  Set high-availability properties for each broker in the cluster.
5.  Start each broker in the cluster.

For a conceptual discussion of enhanced broker clusters and how they
compare to conventional clusters, see "link:../mq-tech-over/broker-clusters.html#GMTOV00028[Broker
Clusters]" in Open Message Queue Technical Overview. For procedural and
reference information about enhanced broker clusters, see
"link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00041[Configuring and Managing Broker Clusters]" and
"link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-properties.html#GMADG00293[Cluster Configuration Properties]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide.

If you have been using a highly available database with Message Queue
4.0 and want to switch to an enhanced broker cluster, you can use the
Database Manager utility (`imqdbmgr` to convert to a shared persistent
data store. Also see link:#aembl[Broker Clusters] for more known issues
and limitations.

[[gglrw]][[GMRLN00054]][[jaas-support]]

JAAS Support
++++++++++++

In addition to the file-based and LDAP-based built-in authentication
mechanisms, Message Queue 4.1 introduced support for the Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), which allows you to
plug an external authentication mechanism into the broker to
authenticate Message Queue clients.

For a description of the information that a broker makes available to a
JAAS-compliant authentication service and an explanation of how to
configure the broker to use such a service, see "link:../mq-admin-guide/security-services.html#GMADG00551[Using
JAAS-Based Authentication]" in Open Message Queue Administration Guide.

[[gglui]][[GMRLN00055]][[persistent-data-store-format-change]]

Persistent Data Store Format Change
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.1 changed the JDBC-based data store to support enhanced
broker clusters. For this reason the format of the JDBC—based data store
is increased to version 410. Format versions 350, 370, and 400 are
automatically migrated to the 410 version.

Please note that the format of the file-based persistent data store
remains at version 370 because no changes were made to it.

[[gglst]][[GMRLN00056]][[broker-environment-configuration]]

Broker Environment Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The property `IMQ_DEFAULT_EXT_JARS` has been added to the Message Queue
4.1 environment configuration file, `imqenv.conf`. You can set this
property to specify the path names of external .jar files to be included
in `CLASSPATH` when the broker starts up. If you use this property to
specify the location of external .jar files, you no longer need to copy
these files to the `lib/ext` directory. External .jar files can refer to
JDBC drivers or to JAAS login modules. The following sample poperty,
specifies the location of JDBC drivers.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_DEFAULT_EXT_JARS=/opt/SUNWhadb4/lib/hadbjdbc4.jar:/opt/SUNWjavadb/derby.jar
----

[[gglsg]][[GMRLN00057]][[java-es-monitoring-framework-support]]

Java ES Monitoring Framework Support
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.1 introduced support for the Sun Java Enterprise System
(Java ES) Monitoring Framework, which allows Java ES components to be
monitored using a common graphical interface. This interface is
implemented by a web-based console called the Sun Java System Monitoring
Console. Administrators can use the Console to view performance
statistics, reate rules for automatic monitoring, and acknowledge
alarms. If you are running Message Queue along with other Java ES
components, you might find it more convenient to use a single interface
to manage all of them.

For information on using the Java ES monitoring framework to monitor
Message Queue, see XREF.

[[gglrx]][[GMRLN00058]][[enhanced-transaction-management]]

Enhanced Transaction Management
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Previously, only transactions in a `PREPARED` state were allowed to be
rolled back administratively. That is, if a session that was part of a
distributed transaction did not terminate gracefully, the transaction
remained in a state that could not be cleaned up by an administrator. In
Message Queue 4.1, you can now use the Command utility (`imqcmd`) to
clean up (roll back) transactions that are in the following states:
`STARTED`, `FAILED`, `INCOMPLETE`, `COMPLETE`, and `PREPARED`.

To help you determine whether a particular transaction can be rolled
back (especially when it is not in a `PREPARED` state), the Command
utility provides additional data as part of the`imqcmd query txn`
output: it provides the connection id for the connection that started
the transaction and specifies the time when the transaction was created.
Using this information, an administrator can decide whether the
transaction needs to be rolled back. In general, the administrator
should avoid rolling back a transaction prematurely.

[[ggluh]][[GMRLN00059]][[fixed-ports-for-c-client-connections]]

Fixed Ports for C Client Connections
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Message Queue 4.1, C clients, like Java clients, can now connect to a
fixed broker port rather than to a port dynamically assigned by the
broker's Port Mapper service. Fixed port connections are useful if
you're trying to get through a firewall or if you need to bypass the
Port Mapper service for some other reason.

To configure a fixed port connection you need to configure both the
broker and the C client run time (both ends of the connection). For
example, if you want to connect your client via `ssljms` to port 1756,
you would do the following:

* On the client side, set the following properties: +
`MQ_SERVICE_PORT_PROPERTY=1756` +
`MQ_CONNECTION_TYPE_PROPERTY=SSL`
* On the broker side, set the `imq.`serviceName.protocolType`.port`
property as follows: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.ssljms.tls.port=1756
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The `MQ_SERVICE_PORT_PROPERTY` connection property has been backported
to Message Queue 3.7 Update 2.

=======================================================================


[[aemac]][[GMRLN00088]][[new-features-in-message-queue-4.0]]

New Features in Message Queue 4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue 4.0 was a minor release limited to supporting Application
Server 9 PE. It included a few new features, some feature enhancements,
and bug fixes. This section includes a description of new features in
this release:

* link:#ggltn[Support for JMX Administration API]
* link:#gglug[Client Runtime Logging]
* link:#ggluw[Connection Event Notification API]
* link:#ggluv[Broker Administration Enhancements]
* link:#ggltd[Displaying Information About a JDBC-Based Data Store]

* link:#ggluc[Persistent Data Store Format Changes]
* link:#ggltz[Additional Message Properties]
* link:#ggluj[SSL Support]


[CAUTION]
=======================================================================

One of the minor but potentially disruptive changes introduced with
version 4.0 was the deprecation of the command-line option to specify a
password. Henceforth, you must store all passwords in a file as
described in link:#gcblj[Deprecated Password Option], or enter them when
prompted.

=======================================================================


[[ggltn]][[GMRLN00060]][[support-for-jmx-administration-api]]

Support for JMX Administration API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A new API was added in Message Queue 4.0 for configuring and monitoring
Message Queue brokers in conformance with the Java Management Extensions
(JMX) specification. Using this API, you can configure and monitor
broker functions programmatically from within a Java application. In
earlier versions of Message Queue, these functions were accessible only
from the command line administration utilities or the Administration
Console.

For more information see the link:../mq-dev-guide-jmx/toc.html#GMJMG[Open Message Queue Developer's
Guide for JMX Clients].

[[gglug]][[GMRLN00061]][[client-runtime-logging]]

Client Runtime Logging
++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.0 introduced support for client runtime logging of
connection and session-related events.

Fore information regarding client runtime logging and how to configure
it, see the Java Dev Guide pag 137.

[[ggluw]][[GMRLN00062]][[connection-event-notification-api]]

Connection Event Notification API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.0 introduced an event notification API that allows the
client runtime to inform an application about changes in connection
state. Connection event notifications allow a Message Queue client to
listen for closure and re-connection events and to take appropriate
action based on the notification type and the connection state. For
example, when a failover occurs and the client is reconnected to another
broker, an application might want to clean up its transaction state and
proceed with a new transaction.

For information about connection events and how to create an event
listener, see the Java Dev Guide, page 96.

[[ggluv]][[GMRLN00063]][[broker-administration-enhancements]]

Broker Administration Enhancements
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Message Queue 4.0, a new subcommand and several command options were
added to the Command utility (`imqcmd)` to allow administrators to
quiesce a broker, to shutdown a broker after a specified interval, to
destroy a connection, or to set java system properties (for example,
connection related properties).

* Quiescing a broker moves it into a quiet state, which allows messages
to be drained before the broker is shut down or restarted. No new
connections can be created to a broker that is being quiesced. To
quiesce the broker, enter a command like the following. +
`imqcmd quiesce bkr -b Wolfgang:1756`
* To shut down the broker after a specified interval, enter a command
like the following. (The time interval specifies the number of seconds
to wait before the broker is shut down.) +
`imqcmd shutdown bkr -b Hastings:1066 -time 90` +
If you specify a time interval, the broker will log a message indicating
when shutdown will occur. For example, +
`Shutting down the broker in 29 seconds (29996 milliseconds)` +
While the broker is waiting to shut down, its behavior is affected in
the following ways.

** Administrative jms connections will continue to be accepted.

** No new jms connections will be accepted.

** Existing jms connections will continue to work.

** The broker will not be able to take over for any other broker in an
enhanced broker cluster.

** The imqcmd utility will not block, it will send the request to shut
down to the broker and return right away.
* To destroy a connection, enter a command like the following. +
`imqcmd destroy cxn -n 2691475382197166336` +
Use the command `imqcmd list cxn` or `imqcmd query cxn` to obtain the
connection ID.
* To set a system property using `imqcmd`, use the new -D option. This
is useful for setting or overriding JMS connection factory properties or
connection-related java system properties. For example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc -secure -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true
imqcmd list svc -secure -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/tmp/mytruststore 
            -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=mytrustword
----

For complete information about the syntax of the `imqcmd` command, see
"link:../mq-admin-guide/command-line-reference.html#GMADG00047[Command Line Reference]" in Open Message Queue
Administration Guide.

[[ggltd]][[GMRLN00064]][[displaying-information-about-a-jdbc-based-data-store]]

Displaying Information About a JDBC-Based Data Store
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Message Queue 4.0 a new `query` subcommand was added to the Database
Manager utility, `imqdbmgr`. This subcommand is used to display
information about a JDBC-based data store, including the database
version, the database user, and whether the database tables have been
created.

The following is an example of the information displayed by the command.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqdbmgr query

        database user=scott
Running in standalone mode.
Database tables have already been created.
----

[[gglse]][[GMRLN00065]][[jdbc-provider-support]]

JDBC Provider Support
+++++++++++++++++++++

In Message Queue 4.0, Apache Derby Version 10.1.1 is now supported as a
JDBC-based data store provider.

[[ggluc]][[GMRLN00066]][[persistent-data-store-format-changes]]

Persistent Data Store Format Changes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.0 introduced changes to the JDBC-based data store for
optimization and to support future enhancements. For this reason the
format of the JDBC-based data store was increased to version 400. Note
that in Message Queue 4.0, the file-based data store version remains 370
because no changes were made to it.

[[ggltz]][[GMRLN00067]][[additional-message-properties]]

Additional Message Properties
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Message Queue 4.0 added two new properties which are set on all messages
that are placed in the dead message queue.

* `JMS_SUN_DMQ_PRODUCING_BROKER` indicates the broker where the message
was produced.
* `JMS_SUN_DMQ_DEAD_BROKER` indicates the broker who marked the message
dead.

[[ggluj]][[GMRLN00068]][[ssl-support]]

SSL Support
+++++++++++

Starting with Message Queue 4.0, the default value for the client
connection factory property `imqSSLIsHostTrusted` is `false.` If your
application depends on the prior default value of `true,` you need to
reconfigure and to set the property explicitly to `true.`

You might choose to trust the host when the broker is configured to use
self-signed certificates. In this case, in addition to specifying that
the connection should use an SSL-based connection service (using the
imqConnectionType property), you should set the `imqSSLIsHostTrusted`
property to true.

For example, to run client applications securely when the broker uses
self-signed certificates, use a command like the following.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java -DimqConnectionType=TLS 
      -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true ClientAppName
----

To use the Command utility (`imqcmd`) securely when the broker uses
self-signed certificates, use a command like the following (for listing
connector services).

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc -secure -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true
----
