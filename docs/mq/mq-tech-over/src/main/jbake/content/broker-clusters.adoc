4 Broker Clusters
-----------------

Message Queue supports the use of broker clusters: groups of brokers
working together to provide message delivery services to clients.
Clusters enable a Message Queue service to scale messaging operations by
distributing client connections among multiple brokers. Because a
cluster consists of multiple brokers, the cluster helps protect against
individual broker failure. Two cluster models provide different levels
of message service availability.

This chapter discusses the architecture and internal functioning of
broker clusters. It covers the following topics:

Cluster Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue supports two clustering models both of which provide a
scalable message service, but with each providing a different level of
message service availability:

* Conventional broker clusters. A conventional broker cluster provides
for service availability. When a broker or a connection fails, clients
connected to the failed broker reconnect to another broker in the
cluster. However, messages and state information stored in the failed
broker cannot be recovered until the failed broker is brought back
online. The broker or connection failure can therefore result in a
significant delay and in JMS message order not being preserved.
* Enhanced broker clusters. An enhanced broker cluster provides for data
availability in addition to service availability. When a broker or a
connection fails, another broker takes over the pending work of the
failed broker. The failover broker has access to the failed broker's
messages and state information. Clients connected to the failed broker
reconnect to the failover broker. In an enhanced cluster, as compared to
a conventional cluster, messages owned by the failed broker are
delivered by the failover broker as soon as it takes over, and JMS
message order semantics are preserved.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Despite the message service availability offered by both conventional
and enhanced broker clusters, they do not provide a guarantee against
failure and the possibility that certain failures, for example in the
middle of a transaction, could require that some operations be repeated.
It is the responsibility of the messaging application (both producers
and consumers) to handle and respond appropriately to failure
notifications from the messaging service.

=======================================================================


Conventional and enhanced broker clusters are built on the same
underlying infrastructure and message delivery mechanisms. They differ
in how brokers in the cluster are synchronized with one another and in
how the cluster detects and responds to failures.

The sections that follow first describe the infrastructure and delivery
mechanisms common to both clustering models, after which the unique
aspects of each model is explained.

[[ggssc]][[GMTOV00066]][[cluster-message-delivery]]

Cluster Message Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A broker cluster facilitates the delivery of messages between client
applications that are connected to different brokers in the cluster.

The following illustration shows salient features of a Message Queue
broker cluster. Each of three brokers is connected to the other brokers
in the cluster: the cluster is fully-connected. The brokers communicate
with each other and pass messages by way of a special cluster connection
service, shown in link:#ggtjt[Figure 4-1] by the dashed lines.

[[GMTOV00018]][[ggtjt]]


.*Figure 4-1 Message Queue Broker Cluster*

"Diagram showing basic elements of a broker cluster. Figure explained in
the text."]


Each broker typically has a set of messaging clients (producers and/or
consumers) that are directly connected to that broker. For these client
applications, the broker to which they are directly connected is called
their home broker. Each client communicates directly only with its home
broker, sending and receiving messages as if that broker were the only
broker in the cluster.

Accordingly, a producer in the cluster produces messages to a
destination in its home broker. The home broker is responsible for
routing and delivering the messages to all consumers of the destination,
whether these consumers are local (connected to the home broker) or
remote (connected to other brokers in the cluster). The home broker
works in concert with the other brokers to deliver messages to all
consumers, no matter what brokers they are connected to.

[[ggyex]][[GMTOV00146]][[propagation-of-information-across-a-cluster]]

Propagation of Information Across a Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate delivery of messages across the cluster, information about
the destinations and consumers of each broker is propagated to all
brokers in the cluster. Each broker therefore stores the following
information:

* The name, type, and properties of all physical destinations in the
cluster
* The name, location, and destination of interest of each message
consumer

Changes in this information are propagated whenever one of the following
events occurs:

* A destination on one of the cluster's brokers is created or destroyed. +
There are minor variations in the propagation of destinations, depending
on the kind of destination:

** Admin-created destinations. When the destination is created, it is
propagated across the cluster. When the destination is deleted on any
broker in the cluster, it's deletion is propagated across the cluster.

** Auto-created destinations. When a producer is created and the
corresponding destination does not exist, the destination is
auto-created on the producer's home broker, but is not immediately
propagated across the cluster. By contrast, when a consumer is created
and the corresponding destination does not exist, the destination is
auto-created on the consumer's home broker and is propagated across the
cluster (as part of the propagation of information about the consumer).
An auto-created destination can be explicitly deleted by an
administrator on each broker. Otherwise, the destination will be
automatically deleted on each broker either when it has had no consumers
and has contained no messages for two minutes, or when the broker
restarts and there are no messages in the destination.

** Temporary destinations. When the destination is programmatically
created, it is propagated across the cluster. If the consumer of the
temporary destination is set to automatically reconnect in the event of
failure, then the destination is stored persistently, and propagated
across the cluster as a persistent destination. When the consumer
connection to the temporary destination closes, the destination is
deleted, and it's deletion is propagated across the cluster. If the home
broker of the consumer of a persistent temporary destination fails and
is restarted, and if the consumer does not reconnect within a specific
time interval, then it is assumed that the consumer has failed and the
temporary destination is deleted, and it's deletion is propagated across
the cluster.
* The properties of a destination are changed.
* A message consumer is registered with its home broker.
* A message consumer is disconnected from its home broker (whether
explicitly or through failure of the client, the broker, or the
network).

The propagation of destination and consumer information across the
cluster means that destinations and consumers are essentially global to
the cluster. In the case of destinations, properties set for a physical
destination (see link:brokers.html#ggtoj[Configuring Physical
Destinations]) apply to all instances of that destination in the
cluster. Distributing producers across a cluster thus results in
cumulative cluster-wide limits specified by destination properties such
as the maximum number of messages, the maximum number of message bytes,
and the maximum number of producers.

[[ggyew]][[GMTOV00147]][[message-delivery-mechanisms]]

Message Delivery Mechanisms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Despite the global nature of destinations and consumers in a cluster, a
home broker has special responsibilities with respect to both its
producers and consumers:

* A producer's home broker is responsible for persisting and routing
messages originating from that producer, for logging, for managing
transactions, and for processing acknowledgements from consuming clients
across the cluster.
* A consumer's home broker is responsible for persisting information
about consumers, for delivering remotely produced messages to the
consumer, for letting a producer's home broker know whether the consumer
is still available, and for letting a producer's home broker know when
each message has been successfully consumed.

The cluster connection service transports payload messages, when needed,
from destinations on a home broker to destinations on remote brokers. It
also transports control messages, such as client acknowledgements, from
remote brokers back to a home broker. The cluster attempts to minimize
message traffic across the cluster. For example, it only sends a message
to a remote broker if the remote broker is home to a consumer of the
message. If a remote broker has two identical consumers for the same
destination (for example two topic subscribers), the message is sent
over the wire only once. (You can further reduce traffic by setting a
destination property specifying that delivery to local consumers has
priority over delivery to remote consumers.)

If secure message delivery is required, you can configure a cluster to
also provide secure, encrypted delivery of messages between brokers.

As a result of the cluster delivery mechanisms described above, each
broker in a cluster stores different persistent messages and maintains
different state information. If a broker fails, the mechanisms for
recovering its persistent information depends on the cluster model being
used, as described in subsequent sections.

[[ggsuc]][[GMTOV00067]][[conventional-clusters]]

Conventional Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue supports two types of conventional clusters:

* Conventional cluster with master broker
* Conventional cluster of peer brokers

Both of these types provide service availability in the same way, but
they differ in the way that cluster persistent state information is
maintained.

The following figures illustrate the two types of conventional broker
cluster.

[[GMTOV00019]][[ggtld]]


.*Figure 4-2 Conventional Broker Cluster with Master Broker*

"Diagram showing elements of a conventional broker cluster with master
broker. Figure explained in the text."]


[[GMTOV00020]][[gkthh]]


.*Figure 4-3 Conventional Broker Cluster of Peer Brokers*
image:img/to_cc-peer-brokers.png[
"Diagram showing elements of a conventional broker cluster of peer
brokers. Figure explained in the text."]


Conventional broker clusters have the following characteristics:

* Data Synchronization +
Each broker has its own respective persistent data store in which
destinations, persistent messages, and other state information is
stored. Some of this information (for example, destinations and durable
subscriptions) has been propagated to the broker from other brokers in
the cluster. If a broker fails, it is possible for this information to
become out of sync with the information stored by other brokers in the
cluster. To guard against this possibility in a conventional broker
cluster, a configuration change record is maintained to track changes to
the cluster's propagated persistent entities. In a conventional cluster
with master broker, one broker, designated as the master broker,
maintains the configuration change record. In a conventional cluster of
peer brokers, the configuration change record is maintained in a JDBC
data store that is accessible to all the brokers. +
When an offline broker comes back online (or when a new broker is added
to the cluster), it consults the configuration change record for
information about destinations and durable subscribers, then exchanges
information with other brokers about its currently active message
consumers. +
In a conventional cluster with master broker, the master broker should
always be the first broker started within the cluster because other
brokers cannot complete their initialization without accessing the
configuration change record. Furthermore, if the master broker goes
offline, destination and durable subscriber information cannot be
propagated across the cluster. Under these conditions, you get an
exception if you try to create, reconfigure, or destroy a destination or
a durable subscription (auto-created destinations and temporary
destinations are not affected), or attempt a related operation.
Similarly, in the absence of a master broker, any client application
attempting to create a durable subscriber or unsubscribe from a durable
subscription gets an error. Nevertheless, client applications can
successfully interact with an existing durable subscriber. +
Message production, delivery, and consumption can continue uninterrupted
without a master broker.
* Failure Detection and Recovery +
A conventional broker cluster detects failures when one broker tries to
send data to another broker and an exception is thrown. When a broker in
the cluster detects the failure of its connection to another broker in
the cluster, it automatically attempts to reconnect to that broker
periodically. If that broker has failed, messages and state information
stored in it cannot be recovered until it is restarted. It is the
responsibility of an administrator to monitor brokers in the cluster by
using Message Queue administration tools (see
link:brokers.html#aerdc[Administration Tools]) and to ensure failed
brokers are brought back online as soon as possible.
* Client Reconnect +
If a broker or its connection to a client fails, the client
automatically attempts to reconnect to the same or another broker in the
cluster. The reconnect is governed by connection properties that specify
the order and frequency by which the client attempts to reconnect to
brokers in the cluster. The broker to which the client successfully
reconnects becomes the client's new home broker. +
In this scenario, the new home broker (if different from the failed
broker) does not have all the client-related state information that was
previously held by the failed broker; for example, messages that have
been consumed by the client or the state of transactions involving the
client. As a result, the failure of a broker in a conventional cluster
can cause a delay in message delivery (until the failed broker restarts
and the client reconnects).

[[ggsxf]][[GMTOV00068]][[enhanced-clusters]]

Enhanced Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following figure illustrates an enhanced broker cluster. An enhanced
broker cluster provides both service availability and data availability.

[[GMTOV00021]][[ggtim]]


.*Figure 4-4 Enhanced Cluster*
image:img/to_hacluster.png[
"Diagram showing elements of an enhanced broker cluster. Figure explained
in the text."]


An enhanced broker cluster has the following characteristics:

* Data Synchronization +
All brokers in an enhanced cluster share a common persistent data store
in which destinations, persistent messages, and other state information
is stored for each broker. Because all brokers share the same data
store, each broker is able to access the state information stored by
other brokers in the cluster. When a broker that has been offline
rejoins the cluster (or when a new broker is added to the cluster) it is
able to access the most current information simply by accessing the
shared data store. Similarly, if a broker fails, another broker is able
to access and take over the failed broker's information in the shared
data store. +
To achieve data availability, the shared data store must be a
highly-available JDBC database. While it is possible to use a shared
data store that is not highly-available, such a data store would
represent a single point of failure for the cluster, and pose a normally
unacceptable risk for a production message service: all brokers in the
cluster would be impacted if the shared data store were to become
unavailable.
* Failure Detection and Recovery +
An enhanced cluster makes use of a distributed heartbeat service by
which brokers inform other brokers that they are online and accessible
by the cluster connection service. The heartbeat service also updates
broker state information in the cluster's shared data store. When no
heartbeat packet is detected from a broker for a configurable number of
heartbeat intervals, the broker is considered suspect of failure. The
other brokers in the cluster then begin to monitor the suspect broker's
state information in the shared data store to confirm whether the broker
is still online. If the suspect broker does not update its state
information within a configurable interval, it is considered to have
failed. There is a trade-off between the speed and the accuracy of
failure detection: configuring the cluster for quick failure detection
increases the likelihood that a slow broker will erroneously be
considered to have failed. +
When a suspect broker is considered to have failed, a failover broker is
selected from among the remaining online brokers to take over the
pending work of the failed broker. +
The failover broker attempts to take over the failed broker's persistent
state (pending messages, destinations, durable subscriptions, pending
acknowledgments, and open transactions) so as to provide uninterrupted
service to the failed broker's clients. If two or more brokers attempt
such a takeover, only the first will succeed (the first acquires a lock
on the failed broker's data in the shared data store, preventing
subsequent takeover attempts). +
The takeover of a failed broker's state happens very rapidly. Then, the
failover broker performs takeover operations such as rolling back
non-prepared transactions, loading messages and routing messages. While
performing these takeover operations, the failover broker cannot accept
new client connections. +
Once takeover is complete and a period for clients to reconnect to the
failover broker has elapsed, the failover broker will clean up any
transient resources (such as completed transactions and temporary
destinations) belonging to the failed broker.
* Client Reconnect +
If a broker fails, its clients automatically reconnect to the failover
broker, which becomes their new home broker. The reconnect process is a
dynamic interplay between the client runtime and the broker cluster: if
a client attempts to reconnect to a broker that is not the failover
broker, the reconnect is rejected and the client is redirected to the
failover broker. +
In this scenario, the new home broker (the failover broker) has
immediate access to all the client-related state information that was
previously held by the failed broker. The failover broker can therefore
take over where the failed broker left off. As a result, the failure of
a broker in an enhanced cluster will not cause its messages to be
unavailable for delivery. However, during the time required for takeover
to complete, the failover broker cannot accept new client connections.

To configure an enhanced cluster you set cluster configuration
properties for each broker in the cluster. These properties are detailed
in "link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00416[Enhanced Broker Cluster Properties]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide.

Cluster Models Compared
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conventional and enhanced cluster models share the same basic
infrastructure. They both use the cluster communication service to
enable message delivery between producers and consumers across the
cluster. However, as shown in the following figure and described in
previous sections, these models differ in how destination and consumer
information is synchronized across the cluster, in the mechanisms for
detecting failure, in how client reconnect takes place.

[[GMTOV00022]][[ggtie]]


.*Figure 4-5 Cluster Infrastructure*
image:img/to_clusterinfrastructure.png[
"Diagram comparing conventional and enhanced broker cluster
infrastructures. Figure explained in the text."]


In addition, while both models rely on the broker's persistence
interfaces (both flat-file and JDBC), in the case of enhanced clusters
the shared data store must be a highly-available JDBC database (a
highly-available file-based data store has not yet been implemented).

The following table summarizes the functional differences between the
two cluster models. This information might help in deciding which model
to use or whether to switch from one to another.

[[aerds]][[GMTOV00070]][[cluster-configuration]]

Cluster Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the clustering model used, you must specify appropriate
broker properties to enable the Message Queue service to manage the
cluster. This information is specified by a set of cluster configuration
properties,. Some of these properties must have the same value for all
brokers in a cluster; others must be specified for each broker
individually. It is recommended that you place all configuration
properties that must be the same for all brokers in one central cluster
configuration file that is referenced by each broker at startup time.
This ensures that all brokers share the same common cluster
configuration information.

See "link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00253[Configuring Broker Clusters]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide for detailed information on cluster
configuration properties.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Although the cluster configuration file was originally intended for
configuring clusters, it is also a convenient place to store other
(non-cluster-related) properties that are shared by all brokers in a
cluster.
