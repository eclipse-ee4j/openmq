6 Working with SOAP Messages
----------------------------

SOAP is a protocol that allows for the exchange of data whose structure
is defined by an XML scheme. Using Message Queue, you can send JMS
messages that contain a SOAP payload. This allows you to transport SOAP
messages reliably and to publish SOAP messages to JMS subscribers. This
chapter covers the following topics:

* link:#aeqey[What is SOAP?]
* link:#aeqfh[SOAP Messaging in JAVA]
* link:#aeqfx[SOAP Messaging Models and Examples]
* link:#aeqgk[Integrating SOAP and Message Queue]

If you are familiar with the SOAP specification, you can skip the
introductory section and start by reading link:#aeqfh[SOAP Messaging in
JAVA].

[[aeqey]][[GMJVG00113]][[what-is-soap]]

What is SOAP?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOAP, the Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol that allows the
exchange of structured data between peers in a decentralized,
distributed environment. The structure of the data being exchanged is
specified by an XML scheme.

The fact that SOAP messages are encoded in XML makes SOAP messages
portable, because XML is a portable, system-independent way of
representing data. By representing data using XML, you can access data
from legacy systems as well as share your data with other enterprises.
The data integration offered by XML also makes this technology a natural
for Web-based computing such as Web services. Firewalls can recognize
SOAP packets based on their content type (`text/xml-SOAP`) and can
filter messages based on information exposed in the SOAP message header.

The SOAP specification describes a set of conventions for exchanging XML
messages. As such, it forms a natural foundation for Web services that
also need to exchange information encoded in XML. Although any two
partners could define their own protocol for carrying on this exchange,
having a standard such as SOAP allows developers to build the generic
pieces that support this exchange. These pieces might be software that
adds functionality to the basic SOAP exchange, or might be tools that
administer SOAP messaging, or might even comprise parts of an operating
system that supports SOAP processing. Once this support is put in place,
other developers can focus on creating the Web services themselves.

The SOAP protocol is fully described at http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP. This
section restricts itself to discussing the reasons why you would use
SOAP and to describing basic concepts that will make it easier to work
with SOAP messages.

[[aeqez]][[GMJVG00240]][[soap-with-attachments-api-for-java]]

SOAP with Attachments API for Java
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Soap with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) is a JAVA-based API that
enforces compliance to the SOAP standard. When you use this API to
assemble and disassemble SOAP messages, it ensures the construction of
syntactically correct SOAP messages. SAAJ also makes it possible to
automate message processing when several applications need to handle
different parts of a message before forwarding it to the next recipient.

link:#gbovv[Figure 6-1] shows the layers that can come into play in the
implementation of SOAP messaging. This chapter focuses on the SOAP and
language implementation layers.

[[GMJVG00001]][[gbovv]]


.*Figure 6-1 SOAP Messaging Layers*
image:img/jax_msglayers1.png[
"Diagram showing the functional layers needed for SOAP messaging. Figure
contents are explained in text."]


The sections that follow describe each layer shown in the preceding
figure in greater detail. The rest of this chapter focuses on the SOAP
and language implementation layers.

[[aeqfa]][[GMJVG00164]][[the-transport-layer]]

The Transport Layer
+++++++++++++++++++

Underlying any messaging system is the transport or wire protocol that
governs the serialization of the message as it is sent across a wire and
the interpretation of the message bits when it gets to the other side.
Although SOAP messages can be sent using any number of protocols, the
SOAP specification defines only the binding with HTTP. SOAP uses the
HTTP request/response message model. It provides SOAP request parameters
in an HTTP request and SOAP response parameters in an HTTP response. The
HTTP binding has the advantage of allowing SOAP messages to go through
firewalls.

[[aeqfb]][[GMJVG00165]][[the-soap-layer]]

The SOAP Layer
++++++++++++++

Above the transport layer is the SOAP layer. This layer, which is
defined in the SOAP Specification, specifies the XML scheme used to
identify the message parts: envelope, header, body, and attachments. All
SOAP message parts and contents, except for the attachments, are written
in XML. The following sample SOAP message shows how XML tags are used to
define a SOAP message:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
   xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
   SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=
           "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
      <SOAP-ENV:Body>
          <m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m="Some-URI">
              <symbol>DIS</symbol>
          </m:GetLastTradePrice>
      </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>


            
----

The wire transport and SOAP layers are actually sufficient to do SOAP
messaging. You could create an XML document that defines the message you
want to send, and you could write HTTP commands to send the message from
one side and to receive it on the other. In this case, the client is
limited to sending synchronous messages to a specified URL.
Unfortunately, the scope and reliability of this kind of messaging is
severely restricted. To overcome these limitations, the provider and
profile layers are added to SOAP messaging.

[[aeqfc]][[GMJVG00166]][[the-language-implementation-layer]]

The Language Implementation Layer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A language implementation allows you to create XML messages that conform
to SOAP, using API calls. For example, the SAAJ implementation of SOAP,
allows a Java client to construct a SOAP message and all its parts as
Java objects. The client would also use SAAJ to create a connection and
use it to send the message. Likewise, a Web service written in Java
could use the same implementation (SAAJ), or any other language
implementation, to receive the message, to disassemble it, and to
acknowledge its receipt.

[[aeqfd]][[GMJVG00167]][[the-profiles-layer]]

The Profiles Layer
++++++++++++++++++

In addition to a language implementation, a SOAP implementation can
offer services that relate to message delivery. These could include
reliability, persistence, security, and administrative control, and are
typically delivered by a SOAP messaging provider. These services will be
provided for SOAP messaging by Message Queue in future releases.

[[aeqfe]][[GMJVG00168]][[interoperability]]

Interoperability
++++++++++++++++

Because SOAP providers must all construct and deconstruct messages as
defined by the SOAP specification, clients and services using SOAP are
interoperable. That is, as shown in link:#gbovh[Figure 6-2], the client
and the service doing SOAP messaging do not need to be written in the
same language nor do they need to use the same SOAP provider. It is only
the packaging of the message that must be standard.

[[GMJVG00002]][[gbovh]]


.*Figure 6-2 SOAP Interoperability*
image:img/jax_interop1.png[
"Diagram showing how a client using one SOAP implementation sends a
message to a client using another SOAP implementation."]


In order for a SAAJ client or service to interoperate with a service or
client using a different implementation, the parties must agree on two
things:

* They must use the same transport bindings--that is, the same wire
protocol.
* They must use the same profile in constructing the SOAP message being
sent.

[[aeqff]][[GMJVG00241]][[the-soap-message]]

The SOAP Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having surveyed the SOAP messaging layers, let's examine the SOAP
message itself. Although the work of rendering a SOAP message in XML is
taken care of by the SAAJ implementation, you must still understand its
structure in order to make the SAAJ calls in the right order.

A SOAP message is an XML document that consists of a SOAP envelope, an
optional SOAP header, and a SOAP body. The SOAP message header contains
information that allows the message to be routed through one or more
intermediate nodes before it reaches its final destination.

* The envelope is the root element of the XML document representing the
message. It defines the framework for how the message should be handled
and by whom. Once it encounters the Envelope element, the SOAP processor
knows that the XML is a SOAP message and can then look for the
individual parts of the message.
* The header is a generic mechanism for adding features to a SOAP
message. It can contain any number of child elements that define
extensions to the base protocol. For example, header child elements
might define authentication information, transaction information, locale
information, and so on. The actors, the software that handle the message
may, without prior agreement, use this mechanism to define who should
deal with a feature and whether the feature is mandatory or optional.
* The body is a container for mandatory information intended for the
ultimate recipient of the message.

A SOAP message may also contain an attachment, which does not have to be
in XML. For more information, see link:#aeqfg[SOAP Packaging Models]
next.

A SOAP message is constructed like a nested matrioshka doll. When you
use SAAJ to assemble or disassemble a message, you need to make the API
calls in the appropriate order to get to the message part that interests
you. For example, in order to add content to the message, you need to
get to the body part of the message. To do this you need to work through
the nested layers: SOAP part, SOAP envelope, SOAP body, until you get to
the SOAP body element that you will use to specify your data. For more
information, see link:#aeqfi[The SOAP Message Object].

[[aeqfg]][[GMJVG00242]][[soap-packaging-models]]

SOAP Packaging Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SOAP specification describes two models of SOAP messages: one that
is encoded entirely in XML and one that allows the sender to add an
attachment containing non-XML data. You should look over the following
two figures and note the parts of the SOAP message for each model. When
you use SAAJ to define SOAP messages and their parts, it will be helpful
for you to be familiar with this information.

link:#gbovm[Figure 6-3] shows the SOAP model without attachments. This
package includes a SOAP envelope, a header, and a body. The header is
optional.

[[GMJVG00003]][[gbovm]]


.*Figure 6-3 SOAP Message Without Attachments*
image:img/jax_soapmsg.png[
"Diagram showing body and header enclosed in an envelope, which is in a
SOAP message package, which is in a communication protocol envelope."]


When you construct a SOAP message using SAAJ, you do not have to specify
which model you're following. If you add an attachment, a message like
that shown in link:#gbovi[Figure 6-4] is constructed; if you don't, a
message like that shown in link:#gbovm[Figure 6-3] is constructed.

link:#gbovm[Figure 6-3] shows a SOAP Message with attachments. The
attachment part can contain any kind of content: image files, plain
text, and so on. The sender of a message can choose whether to create a
SOAP message with attachments. The message receiver can also choose
whether to consume an attachment.

A message that contains one or more attachments is enclosed in a MIME
envelope that contains all the parts of the message. In SAAJ, the MIME
envelope is automatically produced whenever the client creates an
attachment part. If you add an attachment to a message, you are
responsible for specifying (in the MIME header) the type of data in the
attachment.

[[GMJVG00004]][[gbovi]]


.*Figure 6-4 SOAP Message with Attachments*
image:img/jax_soapwatt.png[
"Diagram showing SOAP part enclosed in a MIME envelope together with the
attachment part, which contains the SOAP attachment."]


[[aeqfh]][[GMJVG00114]][[soap-messaging-in-java]]

SOAP Messaging in JAVA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SOAP specification does not provide a programming model or even an
API for the construction of SOAP messages; it simply defines the XML
schema to be used in packaging a SOAP message.

SAAJ is an application programming interface that can be implemented to
support a programming model for SOAP messaging and to furnish Java
objects that application or tool writers can use to construct, send,
receive, and examine SOAP messages. SAAJ defines following package:

* `jakarta.xml.soap`: you use the objects in this package to define the
parts of a SOAP message and to assemble and disassemble SOAP messages.
You can also use this package to send a SOAP message without the support
of a provider.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Beginning with SAAJ 1.3, you must put the file `mail.jar` explicitly in
`CLASSPATH.`

=======================================================================


This chapter focuses on the `jakarta.xml.soap` package and how you use the
objects and methods it defines

* to assemble and disassemble SOAP messages
* to send and receive these messages

It also explains how you can use the JMS API and Message Queue to send
and receive JMS messages that carry SOAP message payloads.

[[aeqfi]][[GMJVG00243]][[the-soap-message-object]]

The SOAP Message Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A SOAP Message Object is a tree of objects as shown in
link:#gbowh[Figure 6-5]. The classes or interfaces from which these
objects are derived are all defined in the `jakarta.xml.soap` package.

[[GMJVG00005]][[gbowh]]


.*Figure 6-5 SOAP Message Object*
image:img/jax_soaporg.png[
"Diagram showing hierarchy of objects that make up a SOAP message object.
Long description follows figure."]


As shown in the figure, the `SOAPMessage` object is a collection of
objects divided in two parts: a SOAP part and an attachment part. The
main thing to remember is that the attachment part can contain non-xml
data.

The SOAP part of the message contains an envelope that contains a body
(which can contain data or fault information) and an optional header.
When you use SAAJ to create a SOAP message, the SOAP part, envelope, and
body are created for you: you need only create the body elements. To do
that you need to get to the parent of the body element, the SOAP body.

In order to reach any object in the SOAPMessage tree, you must traverse
the tree starting from the root, as shown in the following lines of
code. For example, assuming the SOAPMessage is `MyMsg`, here are the
calls you would have to make in order to get the SOAP body:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPPart MyPart = MyMsg.getSOAPPart();
SOAPEnvelope MyEnv = MyPart.getEnvelope();
SOAPBody MyBody = envelope.getBody();
----

At this point, you can create a name for a body element (as described in
link:#aeqfk[Namespaces]) and add the body element to the SOAPMessage.

For example, the following code line creates a name (a representation of
an XML tag) for a body element:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Name bodyName = envelope.createName("Temperature");
----

The next code line adds the body element to the body:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPBodyElement myTemp = MyBody.addBodyElement(bodyName);
----

Finally, this code line defines some data for the body element
`bodyName` :

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
myTemp.addTextNode("98.6");
----

[[aeqfj]][[GMJVG00169]][[inherited-methods]]

Inherited Methods
+++++++++++++++++

The elements of a SOAP message form a tree. Each node in that tree
implements the `Node` interface and, starting at the envelope level,
each node implements the `SOAPElement` interface as well. The resulting
shared methods are described in link:#gbowj[Table 6-1].

|=======================================================================


[[aeqfk]][[GMJVG00170]][[namespaces]]

Namespaces
++++++++++

An XML namespace is a means of qualifying element and attribute names to
disambiguate them from other names in the same document. This section
provides a brief description of XML namespaces and how they are used in
SOAP. For complete information, see
`http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/`

An explicit XML namespace declaration takes the following form:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<prefix:myElement
xmlns:prefix ="URI">
----

The declaration defines prefix as an alias for the specified URI. In the
element `myElement`, you can use prefix with any element or attribute to
specify that the element or attribute name belongs to the namespace
specified by the URI.

The following is an example of a namespace declaration:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
----

This declaration defines `SOAP_ENV` as an alias for the namespace:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/
----

After defining the alias, you can use it as a prefix to any attribute or
element in the `Envelope` element. In link:#gbowf[Example 6-1], the
elements `<Envelope>` and `<Body>` and the attribute `encodingStyle` all
belong to the SOAP namespace specified by the
`http://schemas.sxmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/`URI .

[[GMJVG00058]][[gbowf]]


Example 6-1 Explicit Namespace Declarations

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
   xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
   SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle=
                     "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
   <SOAP-ENV:Header>
        <HeaderA
 xmlns="HeaderURI"
 SOAP-ENV:mustUnderstand="0">
     
      The text of the header
     </HeaderA>
 </SOAP-ENV:Header>
   <SOAP-ENV:Body>
.
.
.
   </SOAP-ENV:Body>
 </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
----

Note that the URI that defines the namespace does not have to point to
an actual location; its purpose is to disambiguate attribute and element
names.

[[aeqfl]][[GMJVG00030]][[pre-defined-soap-namespaces]]

Pre-defined SOAP Namespaces

SOAP defines two namespaces:

* The SOAP envelope, the root element of a SOAP message, has the
following namespace identifier: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope"
----
* The SOAP serialization, the URI defining SOAP's serialization rules,
has the following namespace identifier: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding"
----

When you use SAAJ to construct or consume messages, you are responsible
for setting or processing namespaces correctly and for discarding
messages that have incorrect namespaces.

[[aeqfm]][[GMJVG00031]][[using-namespaces-when-creating-a-soap-name]]

Using Namespaces when Creating a SOAP Name

When you create the body elements or header elements of a SOAP message,
you must use the `Name` object to specify a well-formed name for the
element. You obtain a `Name` object by calling the method
`SOAPEnvelope.createName`.

When you call this method, you can pass a local name as a parameter or
you can specify a local name, prefix, and URI. For example, the
following line of code defines a name object `bodyName`.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Name bodyName = MyEnvelope.createName("TradePrice",
                                 "GetLTP","http://foo.eztrade.com");
----

This would be equivalent to the namespace declaration:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<GetLTP:TradePrice xmlns:GetLTP= "http://foo.eztrade.com">
----

The following code shows how you create a name and associate it with a
`SOAPBody` element. Note the use and placement of the `createName`
method.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SoapBody body = envelope.getBody();//get body from envelope
Name bodyName = envelope.createName("TradePrice", "GetLTP",
                                        "http://foo.eztrade.com");
SOAPBodyElement gltp = body.addBodyElement(bodyName);
----

[[aeqfn]][[GMJVG00032]][[parsing-name-objects]]

Parsing Name Objects

For any given `Name` object, you can use the following `Name` methods to
parse the name:

* `getQualifiedName` returns "prefix:LocalName ", for the given name,
this would be `GetLTP:TradePrice`.
* `getURI` would return `"http://foo.eztrade.com"` .
* `getLocalName` would return "`TradePrice` ".
* `getPrefix` would return "`GetLTP`".

[[aeqfo]][[GMJVG00244]][[destination-message-factory-and-connection-objects]]

Destination, Message Factory, and Connection Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SOAP messaging occurs when a SOAP message, produced by a message factory
, is sent to an endpoint by way of a connection .

If you are working without a provider, you must do the following:

* Create a `SOAPConnectionFactory` object.
* Create a `SOAPConnection object`.
* Create an endpoint object that represents the message's destination.
* Create a `MessageFactory` object and use it to create a message.
* Populate the message.
* Send the message.

The following three sections describe endpoint, message factory, and
connection objects in greater detail.

[[aeqfp]][[GMJVG00171]][[endpoint]]

Endpoint
++++++++

An endpoint identifies the final destination of a message. An endpoint
is defined either by the `String` class or by
the `java.net.URL` class.

[[aeqfq]][[GMJVG00033]][[constructing-an-endpoint]]

Constructing an Endpoint

You can initialize an endpoint by calling its constructor. The following
code uses a constructor to create a `URL` endpoint.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
myEndpoint = new java.net.URL("http://somehost/myServlet");
----

[[aeqfr]][[GMJVG00034]][[using-the-endpoint-to-address-a-message]]

Using the Endpoint to Address a Message

To address a message to an endpoint, specify the endpoint as a parameter
to the `SOAPConnection.call` method, which you use to send a SOAP
message.

[[aeqft]][[GMJVG00172]][[message-factory]]

Message Factory
+++++++++++++++

You use a Message Factory to create a SOAP message.

To instantiate a message factory directly, use a statement like the
following:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance();
----

[[aeqfu]][[GMJVG00173]][[connection]]

Connection
++++++++++

To send a SOAP message using SAAJ, you must obtain a `SOAPConnection` .
You can also transport a SOAP message using Message Queue; for more
information, see link:#aeqgk[Integrating SOAP and Message Queue].

[[gdysa]][[GMJVG00174]][[soap-connection]]

SOAP Connection
+++++++++++++++

A `SOAPConnection` allows you to send messages directly to a remote
party. You can obtain a `SOAPConnection` object simply by calling the
static method `SOAPConnectionFactory.newInstance()`. Neither reliability
nor security are guaranteed over this type of connection.

[[aeqfx]][[GMJVG00115]][[soap-messaging-models-and-examples]]

SOAP Messaging Models and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how you use SAAJ to send and receive a SOAP
message. It is also possible to construct a SOAP message using SAAJ and
to send it as the payload of a JMS message. For information, see
link:#aeqgk[Integrating SOAP and Message Queue].

[[aeqfy]][[GMJVG00245]][[soap-messaging-programming-models]]

SOAP Messaging Programming Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides a brief summary of the programming models used in
SOAP messaging using SAAJ.

A SOAP message is sent to an endpoint by way of a point-to-point
connection (implemented by the `SOAPConnection` class).

You use point-to-point connections to establish a request-reply
messaging model. The request-reply model is illustrated in
link:#gboxm[Figure 6-6].

[[GMJVG00006]][[gboxm]]


.*Figure 6-6 Request-Reply Messaging*
image:img/jax_ppconnection.png[
"Diagram showing the client sending a message to an endpoint that
receives the message, processes it, and then returns to the sender."]


Using this model, the client does the following:

* Creates an endpoint that specifies the URL that will be passed to the
`SOAPConnection.call` method that sends the message. +
See link:#aeqfp[Endpoint] for a discussion of the different ways of
creating an endpoint.
* Creates a SOAPConnection factory and obtains a SOAP connection.
* Creates a message factory and uses it to create a SOAP message.
* Creates a name for the content of the message and adds the content to
the message.
* Uses the `SOAPConnection.call` method to send the message.

It is assumed that the client will ignore the `SOAPMessage` object
returned by the call method because the only reason this object is
returned is to unblock the client.

The SOAP service listening for a request-reply message uses a
`ReqRespListener` object to receive messages.

For a detailed example of a client that does point-to-point messaging,
see link:#aeqgc[Writing a SOAP Client].

[[aeqga]][[GMJVG00246]][[working-with-attachments]]

Working with Attachments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a message contains any data that is not XML, you must add it to the
message as an attachment. A message can have any number of attachment
parts. Each attachment part can contain anything from plain text to
image files.

To create an attachment, you must create a URL object that specifies the
location of the file that you want to attach to the SOAP message. You
must also create a data handler that will be used to interpret the data
in the attachment. Finally, you need to add the attachment to the SOAP
message.

To create and add an attachment part to the message, you need to use the
JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) API. This API allows you to
determine the type of an arbitrary piece of data, encapsulate access to
it, discover the operations available on it, and activate a bean that
can perform these operations. You must include the `activation.jar`
library in your application code in order to work with the JavaBeans
Activation Framework.

queue or topic using Message Queue.

Exception and Fault Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A SOAP application can use two error reporting mechanisms: SOAP
exceptions and SOAP faults:

* Use a SOAP exception to handle errors that occur on the client side
during the generation of the SOAP request or the unmarshalling of the
response.
* Use a SOAP fault to handle errors that occur on the server side when
unmarshalling the request, processing the message, or marshalling the
response. In response to such an error, server-side code should create a
SOAP message that contains a fault element, rather than a body element,
and then it should send that SOAP message back to the originator of the
message. If the message receiver is not the ultimate destination for the
message, it should identify itself as the `soapactor` so that the
message sender knows where the error occurred. For additional
information, see link:#aeqgh[Handling SOAP Faults].

Writing a SOAP Client

The following steps show the calls you have to make to write a SOAP
client for point-to-point messaging.

[[gboxv]][[GMJVG00076]][[to-write-a-soap-client-for-point-to-point-messaging]]

To Write a SOAP Client for Point-to-Point Messaging
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1.  Get an instance of a `SOAPConnectionFactory`: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPConnectionFactory myFct = SOAPConnectionFactory.newInstance();
----
2.  Get a SOAP connection from the `SOAPConnectionFactory` object: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPConnection myCon = myFct.createConnection();
----
The `myCon` object that is returned will be used to send the message.
3.  Get a `MessageFactory` object to create a message: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
MessageFactory myMsgFct = MessageFactory.newInstance();
----
4.  Use the message factory to create a message: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPMessage message = myMsgFct.createMessage();
----
The message that is created has all the parts that are shown in
link:#gboxy[Figure 6-7]. +
[[GMJVG00007]][[gboxy]]


.*Figure 6-7 SOAP Message Parts*
image:img/jax_soapobj.png[
"Diagram showing SOAP message with pre-initialized objects: part,
envelope, header, and body."]

At this point, the message has no content. To add content to the
message, you need to create a SOAP body element, define a name and
content for it, and then add it to the SOAP body. +
Remember that to access any part of the message, you need to traverse
the tree, calling a `get` method on the parent element to obtain the
child. For example, to reach the SOAP body, you start by getting the
SOAP part and SOAP envelope: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPPart mySPart = message.getSOAPPart();
SOAPEnvelope myEnvp = mySPart.getEnvelope();
----
5.  Now, you can get the body element from the `myEnvp` object: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPBody body = myEnvp.getBody();
----
The children that you will add to the body element define the content of
the message. (You can add content to the SOAP header in the same way.)
6.  When you add an element to a SOAP body (or header), you must first
create a name for it by calling the `envelope.createName` method. This
method returns a `Name` object, which you must then pass as a parameter
to the method that creates the body element (or the header element). +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Name bodyName = envelope.createName("GetLastTradePrice", "m",
                                       "http://eztrade.com")
SOAPBodyElement gltp = body.addBodyElement(bodyName);
----
7.  Now create another body element to add to the `gltp` element: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Name myContent = envelope.createName("symbol");
SOAPElement mySymbol = gltp.addChildElement(myContent);
----
8.  And now you can define data for the body element `mySymbol`: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
mySymbol.addTextNode("SUNW");
----
The resulting SOAP message object is equivalent to this XML scheme: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
<SOAP-ENV: Envelope
    xmlns:SOAPENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
        <SOAP-ENV:Body>
            <m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m="http://eztrade.com">
                <symbol>SUNW</symbol>
            </m:GetLastTradePrice>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV: Envelope>
----
9.  Every time you send a message or write to it, the message is
automatically saved. However if you change a message you have received
or one that you have already sent, this would be the point when you
would need to update the message by saving all your changes. For
example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
message.saveChanges();
----
10. Before you send the message, you must create a endpoint object
with the URL of the endpoint to which the message is to be sent. (If you
use a profile that adds addressing information to the message header,
you do not need to do this.) +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
URL endPt = new URL("http://eztrade.com//quotes");
----
11. Now, you can send the message: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPMessage reply = myCon.call(message, endPt);
----
The reply message (`reply`) is received on the same connection.
12. Finally, you need to close the `SOAPConnection` object when it is no
longer needed: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
myCon.close();
----

[[aeqgd]][[GMJVG00249]][[writing-a-soap-service]]

Writing a SOAP Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A SOAP service represents the final recipient of a SOAP message and
should currently be implemented as a servlet. You can write your own
servlet or you can extend the `JAXMServlet` class, which is furnished in
the `soap.messaging` package for your convenience. This section
describes the task of writing a SOAP service based on the `JAXMServlet`
class.

Your servlet must implement either the `ReqRespListener` or
`OneWayListener` interfaces. The difference between these two is that
`ReqRespListener` requires that you return a reply.

Using either of these interfaces, you must implement a method called
`onMessage(SOAPMsg)`. `JAXMServlet` will call `onMessage` after
receiving a message using the `HTTP POST` method, which saves you the
work of implementing your own `doPost()` method to convert the incoming
message into a SOAP message.

link:#gboxu[Example 6-2] shows the basic structure of a SOAP service
that uses the `JAXMServlet` utility class.

[[GMJVG00059]][[gboxu]]

{
    public SOAPMessage onMessage(SOAP Message msg)
    { //Process message here
    }
}

    public SOAPMessage onMessage(SOAPMessage mySoapMessage) {
        return mySoapMessage
    }
}
----

link:#gboxs[Table 6-2] describes the methods that the JAXM servlet uses.
If you were to write your own servlet, you would need to provide methods
that performed similar work. In extending `JAXMServlet` , you may need
to override the `Init` method and the `SetMessageFactory` method; you
must implement the `onMessage` method.

[[GMJVG340]][[sthref67]][[gboxs]]


Table 6-2 `JAXMServlet` Methods

[width="100%",cols="34%,66%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Method |Description
|`void init (ServletConfig)` a|
Passes the `ServletConfig` object to its parent's constructor and
creates a default `messageFactory` object.

If you want incoming messages to be constructed according to a certain
profile, you must call the `SetMessageFactory` method and specify the
profile it should use in constructing SOAP messages.

a|
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
void doPost (HTTPRequest,
HTTPResponse
----

 a|
Gets the body of the HTTP request and creates a SOAP message according
to the default or specified MessageFactory profile.

Calls the `onMessage`() method of an appropriate listener, passing the
SOAP message as a parameter.

It is recommended that you do not override this method.

a|

[[aeqge]][[GMJVG00175]][[disassembling-messages]]

Disassembling Messages
++++++++++++++++++++++

The `onMessage` method needs to disassemble the SOAP message that is
passed to it by the servlet and process its contents in an appropriate
manner. If there are problems in the processing of the message, the
service needs to create a SOAP fault object and send it back to the
client as described in link:#aeqgh[Handling SOAP Faults].

Processing the SOAP message may involve working with the headers as well
as locating the body elements and dealing with their contents. The
following code sample shows how you might disassemble a SOAP message in
the body of your `onMessage` method. Basically, you need to use a
Document Object Model (DOM) API to parse through the SOAP message.

See `http://xml.coverpages.org/dom.html` for more information about the
DOM API.

Handling Attachments
++++++++++++++++++++

A SOAP message may have attachments. For sample code that shows you how
to create and add an attachment, see link:#aeqgn[Code Samples]. For
sample code that shows you how to receive and process an attachment, see
link:#aeqgn[Code Samples].

In handling attachments, you will need to use the Java Activation
Framework API. See
http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/glasgow/jaf.html for more
information.

[[aeqgg]][[GMJVG00177]][[replying-to-messages]]

Replying to Messages
++++++++++++++++++++

In replying to messages, you are simply taking on the client role, now
from the server side.

[[aeqgh]][[GMJVG00178]][[handling-soap-faults]]

Handling SOAP Faults
++++++++++++++++++++

Server-side code must use a SOAP fault object to handle errors that
occur on the server side when unmarshalling the request, processing the
message, or marshalling the response. The `SOAPFault` interface extends
the `SOAPBodyElement` interface.

SOAP messages have a specific element and format for error reporting on
the server side: a SOAP message body can include a SOAP fault element to
report errors that happen during the processing of a request. Created on
the server side and sent from the server back to the client, the SOAP
message containing the `SOAPFault` object reports any unexpected
behavior to the originator of the message.

Within a SOAP message object, the SOAP fault object is a child of the
SOAP body, as shown in the figure below. Detail and detail entry objects
are only needed if one needs to report that the body of the received
message was malformed or contained inappropriate data. In such a case,
the detail entry object is used to describe the malformed data.

[[GMJVG00008]][[gboxc]]


.*Figure 6-8 SOAP Fault Element*
image:img/jax_faultorg.png[
"Diagram showing hierarchy from top to bottom for a message containing
fault information: SOAP part, envelope, body, fault, detail, and detail
entry."]


The SOAP Fault element defines the following four sub-elements:

* `faultcode` +
A code (qualified name) that identifies the error. The code is intended
for use by software to provide an algorithmic mechanism for identifying
the fault. Predefined fault codes are listed in link:#gboxd[Table 6-3].
This element is required.
* `faultstring` +
A string that describes the fault identified by the fault code. This
element is intended to provide an explanation of the error that is
understandable to a human. This element is required.
* `faultactor` +
A URI specifying the source of the fault: the actor that caused the
fault along the message path. This element is not required if the
message is sent to its final destination without going through any
intermediaries. If a fault occurs at an intermediary, then that fault
must include a `faultactor` element.
* `detail` +
This element carries specific information related to the Body element.
It must be present if the contents of the Body element could not be
successfully processed. Thus, if this element is missing, the client
should infer that the body element was processed. While this element is
not required for any error except a malformed payload, you can use it in
other cases to supply additional information to the client.

[[aeqgi]][[GMJVG00035]][[predefined-fault-codes]]

Predefined Fault Codes

The SOAP specification lists four predefined `faultcode` values. The
namespace identifier for these is
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/`.

[[GMJVG341]][[sthref69]][[gboxd]]


Table 6-3 SOAP Faultcode Values

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Faultcode Name |Meaning
a|
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
VersionMismatch 
----

 |The processing party found an invalid namespace for the SOAP envelope
element; that is, the namespace of the SOAP envelope element was not
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/` .

a|
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
MustUnderstand 
----

 |An immediate child element of the SOAP Header element was either not
understood or not appropriately processed by the recipient. This
element's `mustUnderstand` attribute was set to 1 (true).

a|
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Client
----

 a|
The message was incorrectly formed or did not contain the appropriate
information. For example, the message did not have the proper
authentication or payment information. The client should interpret this
code to mean that the message must be changed before it is sent again.

If this is the code returned, the `SOAPFault` object should probably
include a `detailEntry` object that provides additional information
about the malformed message.

a|
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Server 
----

 |The message could not be processed for reasons that are not connected
with its content. For example, one of the message handlers could not
communicate with another message handler that was upstream and did not
respond. Or, the database that the server needed to access is down. The
client should interpret this error to mean that the transmission could
succeed at a later point in time.
|=======================================================================


These standard fault codes represent classes of faults. You can extend
these by appending a period to the code and adding an additional name.
For example, you could define a `Server.OutOfMemory` code, a
`Server.Down` code, and so forth.

[[aeqgj]][[GMJVG00036]][[defining-a-soap-fault]]

Defining a SOAP Fault

Using SAAJ you can specify the value for `faultcode`, `faultstring`, and
`faultactor` using methods of the `SOAPFault` object. The following code
creates a SOAP fault object and sets the `faultcode,` `faultstring,` and
`faultactor` attributes:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPFault fault;
reply = factory.createMessage();
envp = reply.getSOAPPart().getEnvelope(true);
someBody = envp.getBody();
fault = someBody.addFault():
fault.setFaultCode("Server");
fault.setFaultString("Some Server Error");
fault.setFaultActor(http://xxx.me.com/list/endpoint.esp/)
reply.saveChanges();
               
----

The server can return this object in its reply to an incoming SOAP
message in case of a server error.

The next code sample shows how to define a detail and detail entry
object. Note that you must create a name for the detail entry object.

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPFault fault = someBody.addFault();
fault.setFaultCode("Server");
fault.setFaultActor("http://foo.com/uri");
fault.setFaultString ("Unkown error");
Detail myDetail = fault.addDetail();
detail.addDetailEntry(envelope.createName("125detail", "m",
        "Someuri")).addTextNode("the message cannot contain
         the string //");
reply.saveChanges();

[[aeqgk]][[GMJVG00116]][[integrating-soap-and-message-queue]]

Integrating SOAP and Message Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how you can send, receive, and process a JMS
message that contains a SOAP payload.

Message Queue provides a utility to help you send and receive SOAP
messages using the JMS API. With the support it provides, you can
convert a SOAP message into a JMS message and take advantage of the
reliable messaging service offered by Message Queue. You can then
convert the message back into a SOAP message on the receiving side and
use SAAJ to process it.

To send, receive, and process a JMS message that contains a SOAP
payload, you must do the following:

* Import the library `com.sun.messaging.xml.MessageTransformer` . This
is the utility whose methods you will use to convert SOAP messages to
JMS messages and vice versa.
* Before you transport a SOAP message, you must call the
`MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageIntoJMSMessage` method. This method
transforms the SOAP message into a JMS message. You then send the
resulting JMS message as you would a normal JMS message. For programming
simplicity, it would be best to select a destination that is dedicated
to receiving SOAP messages. That is, you should create a particular
queue or topic as a destination for your SOAP message and then send only
SOAP messages to this destination. +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
Message myMsg= MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageIntoJMSMessage
                             (SOAPMessage, Session);
----
The `Session` argument specifies the session to be used in producing the
`Message`.
* On the receiving side, you get the JMS message containing the SOAP
payload as you would a normal JMS message. You then call the
`MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageFromJMSMessage` utility to extract the
SOAP message, and then use SAAJ to disassemble the SOAP message and do
any further processing. For example, to obtain the SOAPMessage make a
call like the following: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
SOAPMessage myMsg= MessageTransformer.SOAPMessageFromJMSMessage
                             (Message, MessageFactory);
----
The `MessageFactory` argument specifies a message factory that the
utility should use to construct the `SOAPMessage` from the given JMS
`Message`.

The following sections offer several use cases and code examples to
illustrate this process.

[[aeqgl]][[GMJVG00250]][[example-1-deferring-soap-processing]]

Example 1: Deferring SOAP Processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first example, illustrated in link:#gboyc[Figure 6-9], an
incoming SOAP message is received by a servlet. After receiving the SOAP
message, the servlet `MyServlet` uses the `MessageTransformer` utility
to transform the message into a JMS message, and (reliably) forwards it
to an application that receives it, turns it back into a SOAP message,
and processes the contents of the SOAP message.

For information on how the servlet receives the SOAP message, see
link:#aeqgd[Writing a SOAP Service].

In the next example, illustrated in link:#gboya[Figure 6-10], an

SOAP message as a JMS message and (reliably) forwards it to a topic.
Each application that subscribes to this topic, receives the JMS
message, turns it back into a SOAP message, and processes its contents.

"Diagram showing how a SOAP message is transformed into a JMS message,
published to listeners, and reconverted into SOAP."]


The code that accomplishes this is exactly the same as in the previous
example, except that instead of sending the JMS message to a queue, you
send it to a topic. For an example of publishing a SOAP message using
Message Queue, see link:#gboxe[Example 6-5].

Code Samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section includes and describes two code samples: one that sends a
JMS message with a SOAP payload, and another that receives the JMS/SOAP
message and processes the SOAP message.

link:#gboxe[Example 6-5] illustrates the use of the JMS API, the SAAJ
API, and the JAF API to send a SOAP message with attachments as the
payload to a JMS message. The code shown for the
`SendSOAPMessageWithJMS` includes the following methods:

* A constructor that calls the `init` method to initialize all the JMS
objects required to publish a message
* A `send` method that creates the SOAP message and an attachment,
converts the SOAP message into a JMS message, and publishes the JMS
message
* A `close` method that closes the connection
* A `main` method that calls the send and close methods

link:#gboww[Example 6-6] illustrates the use of the JMS API, SAAJ, and
the DOM API to receive a SOAP message with attachments as the payload to
a JMS message. The code shown for the `ReceiveSOAPMessageWithJMS`
includes the following methods:

* A constructor that calls the `init` method to initialize all the JMS
objects needed to receive a message.
* An `onMessage` method that delivers the message and which is called by
the listener. The `onMessage` method also calls the message transformer
utility to convert the JMS message into a SOAP message and then uses
SAAJ to process the SOAP body and uses SAAJ and the DOM API to process
the message attachments.
* A `main` method that initializes the `ReceiveSOAPMessageWithJMS`
class.
