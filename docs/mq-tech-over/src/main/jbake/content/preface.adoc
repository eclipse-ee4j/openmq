Preface
-------

This book, the Message Queue Technical Overview, provides an
introduction to the technology, concepts, architecture, capabilities,
and features of the Message Queue messaging service.

As such, this book provides the foundation for other books within the
Message Queue documentation set, and should be read first.

This preface consists of the following sections:

[[who-should-use-this-book]]
Who Should Use This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide is meant for application developers, administrators, and
other parties who plan to use the Message Queue product or who wish to
understand the technology, concepts, architecture, capabilities, and
features of the product. In the context of Message Queue:

* An application developer is responsible for writing Message Queue
client applications that use the Message Queue service to exchange
messages with other client applications.
* An administrator is responsible for setting up and managing a Message
Queue messaging service.

This book does not assume any knowledge of messaging systems or the Java
Message Service (JMS) specification, which is implemented by the Message
Queue service.

[[GMTOV00043]][[gblxf]]


[[before-you-read-this-book]]
Before You Read This Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no prerequisites to this book. You should read this book to
gain an understanding of basic Message Queue concepts and technology
before reading the Message Queue developer and administration guides.

[[GMTOV00109]][[gbqig]]


[[directory-variable-conventions]]
Directory Variable Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue documentation makes use of three directory variables; two
of which represent environment variables needed by Message Queue. (How
you set the environment variables varies from platform to platform.)

The following table describes the directory variables that might be
found in this book and how they are used. Some of these variables refer
to the directory mqInstallHome, which is the directory where Message
Queue is installed to when using the installer or unzipped to when using
a zip-based distribution.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In this book, directory variables are shown without platform-specific
environment variable notation or syntax (such as `$IMQ_HOME` on UNIX).
Non-platform-specific path names use UNIX directory separator (`/`)
notation.

=======================================================================


[width="100%",cols="19%,81%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Variable |Description
|`IMQ_HOME` a|
The Message Queue home directory:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_HOME` is as-install-parent`/mq`, where as-install-parent is the
parent directory of the GlassFish Server base installation directory,
`glassfish3` by default.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` is
mqInstallHome`/mq`.

|`IMQ_VARHOME` a|
The directory in which Message Queue temporary or dynamically created
configuration and data files are stored; `IMQ_VARHOME` can be explicitly
set as an environment variable to point to any directory or will default
as described below:

* For installations of Message Queue bundled with GlassFish Server,
`IMQ_VARHOME` defaults to
as-install-parent`/glassfish/domains/domain1/imq`.
* For installations of Open Message Queue, `IMQ_HOME` defaults to
mqInstallHome`/var/mq`.

|`IMQ_JAVAHOME` |An environment variable that points to the location of
the Java runtime environment (JRE) required by Message Queue executable
files. By default, Message Queue looks for and uses the latest JDK, but
you can optionally set the value of `IMQ_JAVAHOME` to wherever the
preferred JRE resides.
