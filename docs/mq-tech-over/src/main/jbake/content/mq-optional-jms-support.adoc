B Message Queue Features
------------------------

The Message Queue service fully implements the JMS specification for
reliable, asynchronous message delivery. For information about JMS
compliance-related issues, see link:mq-features.html#aerdy[Message Queue
Implementation of Optional JMS Functionality].

Message Queue has additional capabilities and features that exceed JMS
requirements. You can use these features to integrate and monitor
systems consisting of large numbers of distributed components exchanging
many thousands of messages in round-the-clock, mission-critical
operations.

This book has introduced these enterprise-strength features in the
process of describing the Message Queue service. For your convenience,
this appendix provides an alphabetical summary of Message Queue
features: each feature is briefly described, the work required to use
the feature is summarized, and references are provided to sections in
this book that introduce these features and to the specific documents in
the Message Queue documentation set that describe these features in
detail.

|=======================================================================
|Feature |Description and Reference
|Administration tools a|
The Message Queue service includes GUI and command line tools for
managing destinations, transactions, durable subscriptions, administered
object stores, user repositories, JDBC-compliant data stores, and server
certificates.

Also see the JMX-based administration feature described in this table.

Administration Guide

|Authentication a|
Authenticate users seeking a connection to the broker.

The Message Queue service allows users to connect to the broker by
validating their name and password against values stored in a user
repository. The repository can be a flat-file repository shipped with
Message Queue or an LDAP repository (LDAP v2 or v3 protocol).

To Use

1.  Create a user repository or use the default instance.
2.  Use the `imqusermgr` tool to populate the repository.

JAAS-Based Authentication

Application clients can also use authentication services based on the
Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), which allows you
to plug in a variety of services into the broker to authenticate Message
Queue clients. The JAAS API is a core API in J2SE and therefore it is an
integral part of Message Queue's runtime environment.

To Use

1.  The JAAS provider supplies a login module class that implements the
authentication service.
2.  Obtain JAAS configuration file and specify its location using a
system property.
3.  Configure broker properties that relate to JAAS support.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/security-services.html#GMADG00040[Configuring and Managing Security Services]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide

|Authorization a|
Authorize users to perform specific operations.

The Message Queue service allows you to create an access control
properties file that specifies the operations users and groups of users
can perform. The broker checks this file when a client seeks to create a
connection, create a producer, create a consumer, or browse a queue.

To Use

Edit the access control properties file that is automatically created
for the broker instance.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/security-services.html#GMADG00040[Configuring and Managing Security Services]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide

|Automatic reconnect a|
The administrator sets connection attributes on the connection factory
administered object to enable automatic reconnection in the event of
connection or broker failure. Reconnection can be to the same broker or
to another broker in a cluster if a cluster is used. You can specify how
many times to try reconnection and the interval between attempts. You
can also specify how often to iterate through a list of brokers and
whether to iterate through the list in a specific order.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/administered-objects.html#GMADG00042[Managing Administered Objects]" in Open Message Queue
Administration Guide

|Broker clusters a|
The administrator can balance client connections and message delivery
across a number of broker instances by grouping those instances into a
broker cluster. The Message Queue service supports two kinds of
clusters: conventional clusters and high availability clusters

To Use Conventional Clusters

1.  Specify cluster configuration properties for each broker in the
cluster. Specify properties that are the same for all brokers using a
cluster configuration file.
2.  If there is a master broker, start the master broker
3.  Start the other brokers in the cluster.

To Use Enhanced Clusters

1.  Specify cluster configuration properties for each broker in the
cluster (including JDBC-related properties). Specify properties that are
the same for all brokers using a cluster configuration file.
2.  Install your JDBC driver's `.jar` file in the appropriate directory
location.
3.  Use the `imqdbmgr` tool to create the database schema for the highly
available data store.
4.  Start the brokers in the cluster.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-clusters.html#GMADG00041[Configuring and Managing Broker Clusters]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide

|Broker configuration a|
The administrator can set broker properties to tune Message Queue
service performance. This includes routing services, persistence
services, security, monitoring, and administered object management.

link:brokers.html#aercg[The Message Queue Broker]

"link:../mq-admin-guide/broker-configuration.html#GMADG00035[Configuring a Broker]" in Open Message Queue
Administration Guide

|C client support, including support for distributed transactions. a|
C clients can use Message Queue messaging services to send and receive
messages. The C API enables legacy C applications and C++ applications
to participate in JMS-based messaging.

Message Queue's C API is supported by a C client runtime that supports
most of the standard JMS functionality, with the exception of the
following: the use of administered objects; map, stream, or object
message body types; distributed transactions; and queue browsers. The C
client runtime also does not support most of Message Queue's enterprise
features.The Message Queue C-API supports the XA interface (between a
distributed transaction manager and Message Queue as a XA-compliant
resource manager), allowing Message Queue C-API clients running in a
distributed transaction processing environment (such as BEA Tuxedo) to
participate in distributed transactions.

|Client runtime logging a|
Java clients can use all the J2SE 1.4 logging facilities to configure
how the Message Queue client runtime outputs its logging information.
Clients can choose to log the following events: changes in connection
state and miscellaneous connection activities, session-related events,
the creation of producers, consumers, and destinations, and the
consumption and production of messages.

Java clients can configure logging programmatically or by using
configuration files.

Reference

"link:../mq-dev-guide-java/client-design-and-features.html#GMJVG00108[Client Runtime Logging]" in Open Message Queue
Developer's Guide for Java Clients

|Compressed messages a|
Java clients can set a message property to have the client runtime
compress a message being sent. The runtime on the consumer side
decompresses the message before it delivers it to the consumer.
Additional properties are provided that you can use to determine whether
compressing messages would actually improve performance.

|Configurable persistence a|
The administrator can configure the broker to use the file-based
persistent store provided with Message Queue or a JDBC-compliant
database, such as Oracle 8i.

To Use

Set broker properties that relate to file-system persistent storage or
JDBC-compliant storage.

Reference

link:brokers.html#aercs[Persistence Services]

"link:../mq-admin-guide/persistence-services.html#GMADG00039[Configuring Persistence Services]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide

|Configurable physical destinations a|
The administrator can define some messaging behavior by setting physical
destination properties when creating destinations. The following
behavior can be configured for any destination: the maximum number of
unconsumed messages or the maximum amount of memory allowed for such
messages, which messages the broker should reject when memory limits are
reached, the maximum number of producers and consumers, the maximum
message size, the maximum number of messages delivered in a single
batch, whether the destination can deliver only to local consumers, and
whether dead messages on the destination can be moved to the dead
message queue.

Open Message Queue Administration Guide

|Connection event notification a|
Java clients can listen for connection events (like closure or
reconnection) and take appropriate action based on the notification type
and the connection state.

To Use

1.  Use the event notification API to create an event listener.
2.  Add code to the client application that will take appropriate action
depending on the events captured by the event listener.

Reference

"link:../mq-dev-guide-java/client-design-and-features.html#GMJVG00102[Connection Event Notification]" in Open Message Queue
Developer's Guide for Java Clients

|Connection ping a|
The administrator can set a connection factory attribute to specify the
frequency of a ping operation from the client runtime to the broker.
This allows the client to preemptively detect a failed connection.

Reference

link:brokers.html#aerci[Connection Services]

"link:../mq-admin-guide/connection-services.html#GMADG00235[Configuring Connection Services]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide

|Dead message queue a|
The Message Queue message service creates the dead message queue to hold
messages that have expired or that the broker could not process. You can
examine the contents of the queue to monitor, tune, or troubleshoot
system performance.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/message-delivery.html#GMADG00238[Configuring and Managing Physical Destinations]" in
Open Message Queue Administration Guide

|HTTP connections a|
Java clients can create HTTP connections to the broker.

HTTP transport allows messages to be delivered through firewalls.
Message Queue implements HTTP support using an HTTP tunnel servlet that
runs in a web server environment. Messages produced by a client are
wrapped by the client runtime as HTTP requests and delivered over HTTP
through a firewall to the tunnel servlet. The tunnel servlet extracts
the JMS message from the HTTP request and delivers the message over
TCP/IP to the broker.

To Use

1.  Deploy HTTP tunnel servlet on a web server.
2.  Configure broker's `httpjms` connection service and start the
broker.
3.  Configure HTTP connection.
4.  Obtain an HTTP connection to the broker. (Java clients only.)

|Interactive monitoring a|
The administrator can use the `imqcmd metrics` command to monitor a
broker remotely. Monitored data includes JVM metrics, broker message
flow, connections, connection resources, messages, destination message
flow, destination consumers, destination resource use.

Reference

link:brokers.html#aercy[Monitoring Services]

"link:../mq-admin-guide/monitoring.html#GMADG00044[Monitoring Broker Operations]" in Open Message Queue
Administration Guide

|Jakarta EE resource adapters a|
Message Queue provides a resource adapter that can be plugged into a
Jakarta EE-compliant application server. By using Message Queue as a JMS
provider, an application server meets the Jakarta EE requirement that
distributed components running in the application server be able to
interact using reliable, asynchronous message.

To Use

Configure the adapter by setting adapter attributes.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/jmsra-properties.html#GMADG00051[JMS Resource Adapter Property Reference]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide

|Java ES Monitoring Framework support a|
The Java ES Monitoring Framework allows administrators to use the same
interface to manage any and all Java ES components. If you are using
Message Queue with other Java ES components, it might be more convenient
to manage these from a single console. Administrators can use the Sun
Java System Monitoring Console to view performance statistics, create
rules to monitor automatically, and acknowledge alarms. To enable Java
ES monitoring, you must do the following:

* Install and configure the components in your deployment; for example,
Message Queue and the application server.
* Enable and configure the Monitoring Framework for all your monitored
components.
* Install the Monitoring Console on a separate host, start the master
agent, and then start the web server.

For information, see the Sun Java Enterprise System Monitoring Guide.

|JMS Bridge Service a|
The JMS bridge service enables a Message Queue broker to map its
destinations to destinations in external JMS providers, effectively
allowing the Message Queue broker to communicate with clients of the
external JMS provider. The JMS bridge service supports any number of
uniquely named JMS bridges in a broker. Each bridge consists of two
primary components:

* One or more links that each map a destination in the Message Queue
broker to a destination in an external JMS provider or in another
Message Queue broker. To provide destination mapping, each link consists
of a source that specifies the destination from which the JMS bridge
receives messages and a target that specifies the destination to which
the JMS bridge forwards messages received from the source.
* A built-in Dead Message Queue where undeliverable messages are sent.
Additional, special-purpose DMQs can also be specified.

|JMX-Based Administration a|
Java clients can use the JMX API to monitor and manage broker resources:
the broker, services, connections, destinations, consumers, producers,
and so on. You can use JMX-based administration in different ways to
monitor application performance, to configure and monitor broker
services, to automate tasks, or to write custom tools.

|JNDI service provider support a|
Clients can look up administered objects using the JNDI API.

Administrators can use the `imqobjmgr` utility to add, list, update, and
delete administered objects in an object store accessible using JNDI.

|LDAP Server support a|
An administrator can use an LDAP server as a Message Queue administered
object store and as a user repository (needed for authentication). By
default Message Queue provides file-based storage for this data.

To Use as an Administered Object Store

1.  Use the tools provided by the LDAP vendor to set up the LDAP server.
2.  Set the LDAP-related broker properties to define the initial context
and the location of the object store.
3.  Set the LDAP-related broker properties that relate to securing the
LDAP server operations.

Reference

"link:../mq-admin-guide/security-services.html#GMADG00040[Configuring and Managing Security Services]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide

|Memory resource management a|
The administrator can configure the following behavior:

1.  Set properties on a destination to specify the maximum number of
producers, the maximum number of messages, and the maximum size of any
one message.
2.  Set properties on a destination to control message flow.
3.  Set properties on a destination to manage message flow for each
destination.
4.  Set properties on the broker to specify message limits on all
destinations for that broker.
5.  Set properties on the broker to specify thresholds of available
system memory at which the broker takes action to prevent memory
overload. The action taken depends on the state of memory resources.

|Message compression a|
The developer can set a message header property to have the client
runtime compress a message before sending it. The client runtime on the
consumer side decompresses the message before delivering it to the
consumer.

|Message flow control to clients a|
The administrator or the developer can configure a connection to specify
various flow limits and metering schemes to minimize the collision of
payload and control messages, and thereby to maximize message
throughput.

To Use

Set the flow-control attributes for the connection factory administered
object (administrator), or set the flow-control properties for the
connection factory (developer).

Administration Guide

|Message-based monitoring API a|
Java clients can use a monitoring API to create custom monitoring
applications. A monitoring application is a consumer that retrieves
metrics messages from special metrics topic destinations.

To Use

1.  Write a metrics monitoring client.
2.  Set broker properties to configure the broker's metrics message
producer.
3.  Set access controls on metrics topic destinations.
4.  Start the monitoring client.

Administration Guide

|Multiple destinations for publishers and subscribers a|
Publishers can publish messages to multiple topic destinations and
subscribers can consume messages from multiple topic destinations by
using a destination name that includes wildcard characters, representing
multiple destinations. Using such symbolic names allows administrators
to create additional topic destinations, as needed, consistent with the
wildcard naming scheme. Publishers and subscribers automatically publish
to and consume from the added destinations. (Wildcard destination
consumers are more common than publishers.)

Reference

"link:../mq-admin-guide/message-delivery.html#GMADG00069[Supported Topic Destination Names]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide

|Queue delivery to multiple consumers a|
Clients can register more than one consumer for a given queue.

The administrator can specify the maximum number of active consumers and
the maximum number of backup consumers for the queue. The broker
distributes messages to the registered consumers, balancing the load
among them in order to allow the system to scale.

To Use

Set physical destination properties `maxNumActiveConsumers` and
`maxNumBackupConsumers`.

"link:../mq-admin-guide/physical-destination-properties.html#GMADG00049[Physical Destination Property Reference]" in Open
Message Queue Administration Guide

|Reliable data persistence a|
To obtain absolute reliability you can require that the operating system
write the data synchronously to the persistent store by setting the
`imq.persist.file.sync.enabled` property to true. This eliminates
possible data loss due to system crashes, but at the expense of
performance. Note that although the data is not lost, it is not
available to any other broker (in a cluster) because data is not
currently shared by clustered brokers. When the system comes back up,
the broker can reliably resume operations.

Administration Guide

|Schema validation of XML messages a|
Enables validation of the content of a text (not object) XML message
against an XML schema at the point the message is sent to the broker.
The location of the XML schema (XSD) is specified as a property of a
Message Queue destination. If no XSD location is specified, the DTD
declaration within the XML document is used to perform DTD validation.
(XSD validation, which includes data type and value range validation, is
more rigorous than DTD validation.)

Reference

"link:../mq-admin-guide/physical-destination-properties.html#GMADG00297[Physical Destination Properties]" in Open Message
Queue Administration Guide

|Secure connections a|
Clients can secure transmission of messages using the Secure Socket
Layer (SSL) standard over TCP/IP and HTTP transports. These SSL-based
connection services allow for the encryption of messages sent between
clients and broker.

SSL support is based on self-signed server certificates. Message Queue
provides a utility that generates a private/public key pair and embeds
the public key in a self-signed certificate. This certificate is passed
to any client requesting a connection to the broker, and the client uses
the certificate to set up an encrypted connection.

To Use

1.  Generate a self-signed or signed certificate.
2.  Enable the secure service.
3.  Start the broker.
4.  Configure client security connection properties and run the client.

Queue Developer's Guide for C Clients

|Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) support a|
Clients can receive SOAP (XML) messages and they can wrap them as JMS
messages and use Message Queue to exchange them as they would a JMS
message.

Clients can use a special servlet to receive SOAP messages; they can use
a utility class to wrap a SOAP message as a JMS message; they can use
another utility class to extract the SOAP message from the JMS message.
Clients can use standard SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)
libraries to assemble and disassemble a SOAP message.

|STOMP Bridge Service a|
The STOMP bridge service enables a Message Queue broker to communicate
with clients that use the Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol
defined by the `http://stomp.codehaus.org` open source project.

The STOMP bridge service provides the features need to fully integrate
STOMP messaging into the JMS messaging environment of Message Queue:

* Registration with the Message Queue Port Mapper service so that STOMP
clients can discover the service dynamically
* Support for TCP and SSL/TLS connections, including those requiring
client authentication
* Automatic conversion of STOMP frame messages to and from JMS
`BytesMessage` and `TextMessage` types
* Support for the full STOMP protocol, including the STOMP JMS bindings

|Thread management a|
The administrator can specify the maximum and minimum number of threads
assigned to any specific connection service. The administrator can also
determine whether a connection service could increase throughput by
using a shared thread model, which allows threads dedicated to idle
connections to be used by other connections.

To Use

Set connection service thread-related properties.

threading resources, message flow, connection services, reliability
parameters, and other elements that affect message throughput and system
performance.

Guide

|Universal Message Service (UMS) a|
Message Queue includes a universal messaging service (UMS) and messaging
API that provides access to Message Queue from any http-enabled device.
As a result, almost any application can communicate with any other
application and benefit from the reliability and guaranteed delivery of
JMS messaging. In addition, the UMS provides enhanced scalability for
JMS messaging, allowing the number of messaging clients to reach
internet-scale proportions.

The simple, language-independent, protocol-based UMS API supports both
web-based and non-web-based applications, and can be used with both
scripting and programming languages. The API is offered in two styles: a
simple messaging API that uses a Representational State Transfer
(REST)-style protocol, and an XML messaging API that embeds the protocol
in a SOAP message header. In both cases, however, the API requires only
a single http request to send or receive a message.
