9 Configuring and Managing Security Services
--------------------------------------------

This chapter describes Message Queue's facilities for security-related
administration tasks, such as configuring user authentication, defining
access control, configuring a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection
service to encrypt client-broker communication, and setting up a
password file for administrator account passwords. In addition to
Message Queue's own built-in authentication mechanisms, you can also
plug in a preferred external service based on the Java Authentication
and Authorization Service (JAAS) API.

Introduction to Security Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue provides security services for user access control
(authentication and authorization) and for encryption:

* Authentication ensures that only verified users can establish a
connection to a broker.
* Authorization specifies which users or groups have the right to access
resources and to perform specific operations.
* Encryption protects messages from being tampered with during delivery
over a connection.

As a Message Queue administrator, you are responsible for setting up the
information the broker needs to authenticate users and authorize their
actions. The broker properties pertaining to security services are
listed under link:broker-properties.html#aeony[Security Properties]. The
boolean property `imq.accesscontrol.enabled` acts as a master switch
that controls whether access control is applied on a brokerwide basis;
for finer control, you can override this setting for a particular
connection service by setting the `imq.`serviceName
`.accesscontrol.enabled` property, where serviceName is the name of the
connection service, as shown in link:connection-services.html#gbnjw[Table
6-1]: for example, `imq.httpjms.accesscontrol.enabled`.

The following figure shows the components used by the broker to provide
authentication and authorization services. These services depend on a
user repository containing information about the users of the messaging
system: their names, passwords, and group memberships. In addition, to
authorize specific operations for a user or group, the broker consults
an access control file that specifies which operations a user or group
can perform. You can designate a single access control file for the
broker as a whole, using the configuration property
`imq.accesscontrol.file.filename`, or for a single connection service
with `imq`.serviceName. `accesscontrol.file.filename`.

"Diagram showing broker's security services using authentication modules
and an access control file."]


As link:#ggydo[Figure 9-1] shows, you can store user data in a flat file
user repository that is provided with the Message Queue service, you can
access an existing LDAP repository, or you can plug in a Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) module.

* If you choose a flat-file repository, you must use the `imqusermgr`
utility to manage the repository. This option is easy to use and
built-in.
* If you want to use an existing LDAP server, you use the tools provided
by the LDAP vendor to populate and manage the user repository. You must
also set properties in the broker instance configuration file to enable
the broker to query the LDAP server for information about users and
groups. +
The LDAP option is better if scalability is important or if you need the
repository to be shared by different brokers. This might be the case if
you are using broker clusters.
* If you want to plug-in an existing JAAS authentication service, you
need to set the corresponding properties in the broker instance
configuration file.

The broker's `imq.authentication.basic.user_repository` property
specifies which type of repository to use. In general, an LDAP
repository or JAAS authentication service is preferable if scalability
is important or if you need the repository to be shared by different
brokers (if you are using broker clusters, for instance). See
link:#aeofg[User Authentication] for more information on setting up a
flat-file user repository, LDAP access, or JAAS authentication service.

[[aeocv]][[GMADG00546]][[authentication]]

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A client requesting a connection to a broker must supply a user name and
password, which the broker compares with those stored in the user
repository. Passwords transmitted from client to broker are encoded
using either base-64 encoding (for flat-file repositories) or message
digest (MD5) hashing (for LDAP repositories). The choice is controlled
by the `imq.authentication.type` property for the broker as a whole, or
by `imq`.serviceName. `authentication.type` for a specific connection
service. The `imq.authentication.client.response.timeout` property sets
a timeout interval for authentication requests.

As described under link:#aeogq[Password Files], you can choose to put
your passwords in a password file instead of being prompted for them
interactively. The boolean broker property `imq`.`passfile.enabled`
controls this option. If this property is true, the
`imq.passfile.dirpath` and `imq.passfile.name` properties give the
directory path and file name for the password file. The
`imq.imqcmd.password` property (which can be embedded in the password
file) specifies the password for authenticating an administrative user
to use the Command utility (`imqcmd`) for managing brokers, connection
services, connections, physical destinations, durable subscriptions, and
transactions.

If you are using an LDAP-based user repository, there are a whole range
of broker properties available for configuring various aspects of the
LDAP lookup. The address (host name and port number) of the LDAP server
itself is specified by `imq.user_repository.ldap.server`. The
`imq.user_repository.ldap.principal` property gives the distinguished
name for binding to the LDAP repository, while
`imq.user_repository.ldap.password` supplies the associated password.
Other properties specify the directory bases and optional JNDI filters
for individual user and group searches, the provider-specific attribute
identifiers for user and group names, and so forth; see
link:broker-properties.html#aeony[Security Properties] for details.

[[aeocw]][[GMADG00547]][[authorization]]

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once authenticated, a user can be authorized to perform various Message
Queue-related activities. As a Message Queue administrator, you can
define user groups and assign individual users membership in them. The
default access control file explicitly refers to only one group, `admin`
(see link:#aeofm[User Groups and Status]). A user in this group has
connection permission for the `admin` connection service, which allows
the user to perform administrative functions such as creating
destinations and monitoring and controlling a broker. A user in any
other group that you define cannot, by default, get an `admin` service
connection.

When a user attempts to perform an operation, the broker checks the
user's name and group membership (from the user repository) against
those specified for access to that operation (in the access control
file). The access control file specifies permissions to users or groups
for the following operations:

* Connecting to a broker
* Accessing destinations: creating a consumer, a producer, or a queue
browser for any given destination or for all destinations
* Auto-creating destinations

For information on configuring authorization, see link:#aeofu[User
Authorization].

[[aeocx]][[GMADG00548]][[encryption]]

Encryption
^^^^^^^^^^

To encrypt messages sent between clients and broker, you need to use a
connection service based on the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) standard. SSL
provides security at the connection level by establishing an encrypted
connection between an SSL-enabled broker and client.

To use an SSL-based Message Queue connection service, you generate a
public/private key pair using the Message Queue Key Tool utility
(`imqkeytool`). This utility embeds the public key in a self-signed
certificate and places it in a Message Queue key store. The key store is
itself password-protected; to unlock it, you must provide a key store
password at startup time, specified by the `imq.keystore.password`
property. Once the key store is unlocked, a broker can pass the
certificate to any client requesting a connection. The client then uses
the certificate to set up an encrypted connection to the broker.

For information on configuring encryption, see link:#aeogb[Message
Encryption].

[[aeofg]][[GMADG00247]][[user-authentication]]

User Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users attempting to connect to a Message Queue message broker must
provide a user name and password for authentication. The broker will
grant the connection only if the name and password match those in a
broker-specific user repository listing the authorized users and their
passwords. Each broker instance can have its own user repository, which
you as an administrator are responsible for maintaining. This section
tells how to create, populate, and manage the user repository.

Message Queue can support any of three types of authentication
mechanism:

* A flat-file repository that is shipped with Message Queue. This type
of repository is very easy to populate and manage, using the Message
Queue User Manager utility (`imqusermgr`). See link:#aeofh[Using a
Flat-File User Repository].
* A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server. This could be a
new or existing LDAP directory server using the LDAP v2 or v3 protocol.
You use the tools provided by the LDAP vendor to populate and manage the
user repository. This type of repository is not as easy to use as the
flat-file repository, but it is more scalable and therefore better for
production environments. See link:#aeofr[Using an LDAP User Repository].
* An external authentication mechanism plugged into Message Queue by
means of the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) API.
See link:#gepfq[Using JAAS-Based Authentication].

[[aeofh]][[GMADG00549]][[using-a-flat-file-user-repository]]

Using a Flat-File User Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Message Queue provides a built-in flat-file user repository and a
command line tool, the User Manager utility (`imqusermgr`), for
populating and managing it. Each broker has its own flat-file user
repository, created automatically when you start the broker. By default,
the user repository resides in a file named `passwd`, in a directory
identified by the name of the broker instance with which the repository
is associated:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
IMQ_VARHOME/instances/instanceName/etc/passwd
----

If you have changed these file name or directory defaults using the
`imq.user_repository.file.filename` or
`imq.user_repository.file.dirpath` broker properties, you must use the
`-D` option to specify the non-default values when running `imqusermgr`
if you did not specify the values in the broker properties file. For
example, if `imq.user_repository.file.dirpath` is specified in a cluster
configuration file, start `imqusermgr` using the form:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr -Dimq.cluster.url=location-of-cluster-properties-file ...
----

As another example, if `imq.user_repository.file.filename` is specified
on the `imqbrokerd` command line to start the broker, start `imqusermgr`
using the form:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr -Dimq.user_repository.file.filename=filename-used-in-imqbrokerd-command ...
----

[[aeofm]][[GMADG00404]][[user-groups-and-status]]

User Groups and Status
++++++++++++++++++++++

Each user in the repository can be assigned to a user group, which
defines the default access privileges granted to all of its members. You
can then specify authorization rules to further restrict these access
privileges for specific users, as described in link:#aeofu[User
Authorization]. A user's group is assigned when the user entry is first
created, and cannot be changed thereafter. The only way to reassign a
user to a different group is to delete the original user entry and add
another entry specifying the new group.

The flat-file user repository provides three predefined groups:

`admin`::
  For broker administrators. By default, users in this group are granted
  the access privileges needed to configure, administer, and manage
  message brokers.
`user`::
  For normal (non-administrative) client users. Newly created user
  entries are assigned to this group unless otherwise specified. By
  default, users in this group can connect to all Message Queue
  connection services of type `NORMAL`, produce messages to or consume
  messages from all physical destinations, and browse messages in any
  queue.
`anonymous`::
  For Message Queue clients that do not wish to use a user name known to
  the broker (for instance, because they do not know of a real user name
  to use). This group is analogous to the anonymous account provided by
  most FTPservers. No more than one user at a time can be assigned to
  this group. You should restrict the access privileges of this group in
  comparison to the `user` group, or remove users from the group at
  deployment time.

You cannot rename or delete these predefined groups or create new ones.

In addition to its group, each user entry in the repository has a user
status: either active or inactive . New user entries added to the
repository are marked active by default. Changing a user's status to
inactive rescinds all of that user's access privileges, making the user
unable to open new broker connections. Such inactive entries are
retained in the user repository, however, and can be reactivated at a
later time. If you attempt to add a new user with the same name as an
inactive user already in the repository, the operation will fail; you
must either delete the inactive user entry or give the new user a
different name.

To allow the broker to be used immediately after installation without
further intervention by the administrator, the flat-file user repository
is created with two initial entries, summarized in link:#gbnkj[Table
9-1]:

* The `admin` entry (user name and password `admin`/`admin`) enables you
to administer the broker with Command utility (`imqcmd`) commands.
Immediately on installation, you should update this initial entry to
change its password (see link:#gewbm[Changing a User's Password]).
* The `guest` entry allows clients to connect to the broker using a
default user name and password (`guest`/`guest`).

You can then proceed to add any additional user entries you need for
individual users of your message service.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Message Queue User Manager utility (`imqusermgr`) enables you to
populate or edit a flat-file user repository.

general reference information about the syntax, subcommands, and options
of the `imqusermgr` command.

[[gewcl]][[GMADG00070]][[user-manager-preliminaries]]

User Manager Preliminaries

Before using the User Manager, keep the following things in mind:

* The `imqusermgr` command must be run on the host where the broker is
installed.
* If a broker-specific user repository does not yet exist, you must
start up the corresponding broker instance to create it.
* You must have appropriate permissions to write to the repository; in
particular, on Solaris and Linux platforms, you must be logged in as the
root user or the user who first created the broker instance.

[[aeofl]][[GMADG00071]][[subcommands-and-general-options]]

Subcommands and General Options

[[gewcp]][[GMADG00072]][[displaying-the-product-version]]

Displaying the Product Version

To display the Message Queue product version, use the `-v` option. For
example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr  -v
----

If you enter an `imqusermgr` command line containing the `-v` option in
addition to a subcommand or other options, the User Manager utility
processes only the `-v` option. All other items on the command line are
ignored.

[[gewat]][[GMADG00073]][[displaying-help]]

Displaying Help

To display help on the `imqusermgr` command, use the `-h` option, and do
not use a subcommand. You cannot get help about specific subcommands.

For example, the following command displays help about `imqusermgr`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr  -h
----

If you enter an `imqusermgr` command line containing the `-h` option in
addition to a subcommand or other options, the Command utility processes
only the `-h` option. All other items on the command line are ignored.

[[gewbc]][[GMADG00074]][[adding-a-user-to-the-repository]]

Adding a User to the Repository

The subcommand `imqusermgr` `add` adds an entry to the user repository,
consisting of a user name and password:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr add  [-i brokerName]
-u userName  -p password
                   [-g group]
----

The `-u` and `-p` options specify the user name and password,
respectively, for the new entry. These must conform to the following
conventions:

* All user names and passwords must be at least one character long.
Their maximum length is limited only by command shell restrictions on
the maximum number of characters that can be entered on a command line.
* A user name cannot contain an asterisk (`*`), a comma (`,`), a colon
(`:`), or a new-line or carriage-return character.
* If a user name or password contains a space, the entire name or
password must be enclosed in quotation marks (`" "`).

The optional `-g` option specifies the group (`admin`, `user`, or
`anonymous`) to which the new user belongs; if no group is specified,
the user is assigned to the `user` group by default. If the broker name
(`-i` option) is omitted, the default broker `imqbroker` is assumed.

For example, the following command creates a user entry on broker
`imqbroker` for a user named `AliBaba`, with password `Sesame`, in the
`admin` group:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr add  -u AliBaba  -p Sesame  -g admin
----

[[gewcb]][[GMADG00075]][[deleting-a-user-from-the-repository]]

Deleting a User From the Repository

The subcommand `imqusermgr` `delete` deletes a user entry from the
repository:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr delete  [-i brokerName]
-u userName
----

The `-u` option specifies the user name of the entry to be deleted. If
the broker name (`-i` option) is omitted, the default broker `imqbroker`
is assumed.

For example, the following command deletes the user named `AliBaba` from
the user repository on broker `imqbroker`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr delete  -u AliBaba 
----

[[gewbm]][[GMADG00076]][[changing-a-users-password]]

Changing a User's Password

You can use the subcommand `imqusermgr` `update` to change a user's
password:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr update  [-i brokerName]
-u userName  -p password
----

The `-u` identifies the user; `-p` specifies the new password. If the
broker name (`-i` option) is omitted, the default broker `imqbroker` is
assumed.

For example, the following command changes the password for user
`AliBaba` to `Shazam` on broker `imqbroker`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr update  -u AliBaba  -p Shazam
----


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

For the sake of security, you should change the password of the `admin`
user from its initial default value (`admin`) to one that is known only
to you. The following command changes the default administrator password
for broker `mybroker` to `veeblefetzer`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr update  -i mybroker  -u admin  -p veeblefetzer
----

You can quickly confirm that this change is in effect by running any of
the command line tools when the broker is running. For example, the
following command will prompt you for a password:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc  mybroker  -u admin
----

Entering the new password (`veeblefetzer`) should work; the old password
should fail.

After changing the password, you should supply the new password whenever
you use any of the Message Queue administration tools, including the
Administration Console.

=======================================================================


[[gewba]][[GMADG00077]][[activating-or-deactivating-a-user]]

Activating or Deactivating a User

The `imqusermgr` `update` subcommand can also be used to change a user's
active status:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr update  [-i brokerName]
-u userName  -a activeStatus
----

The `-u` identifies the user; `-a` is a boolean value specifying the
user's new status as active (`true`) or inactive (`false`). If the
broker name (`-i` option) is omitted, the default broker `imqbroker` is
assumed.

For example, the following command sets user `AliBaba`'s status to
inactive on broker `imqbroker`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr update  -u AliBaba  -a false
----

This renders `AliBabe` unable to open new broker connections.

You can combine the `-p` (password) and `-a` (active status) options in
the same `imqusermgr` `update` command. The options may appear in either
order: for example, both of the following commands activate the user
entry for `AliBaba` and set the password to `plugh`:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqusermgr update  -u AliBaba  -p plugh  -a true
imqusermgr update  -u AliBaba  -a true  -p plugh
----

[[aeofp]][[GMADG00078]][[viewing-user-information]]

----

The command

[source,oac_no_warn]

[[aeofr]][[GMADG00550]][[using-an-ldap-user-repository]]

Using an LDAP User Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You configure a broker to use an LDAP directory server by setting the
values for certain configuration properties in the broker's instance
configuration file (`config.properties`). These properties enable the
broker instance to query the LDAP server for information about users and
groups when a user attempts to connect to the broker or perform
messaging operations.

* The `imq.authentication.basic.user_repository` property specifies the
kind of user authentication the broker is to use. By default, this
property is set to `file`, for a flat-file user repository. For LDAP
authentication, set it to `ldap` instead: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.authentication.basic.user_repository =ldap
----
* The `imq.authentication.type` property controls the type of encoding
used when passing a password between client and broker. By default, this
property is set to `digest`, denoting MD5 encoding, the form used by
flat-file user repositories. For LDAP authentication, set it to `basic`
instead: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.authentication.type=basic
----
This denotes base-64 encoding, the form used by LDAP user repositories.
* The following properties control various aspects of LDAP access. See
link:broker-properties.html#gewfp[Table 17-11] for more detailed
information: +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.server` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.principal` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.password` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.`propertyName +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.base` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.uidattr` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.usrfilter` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.grpsearch` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.grpbase` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.gidattr` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.memattr` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.grpfilter` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.timeout` +
`imq.user_repository.ldap.ssl.enabled`
* The `imq.user_repository.ldap.userformat` property, if set to a value
of `dn`, specifies that the login username for authentication be in DN
username format (for example:
`uid=mquser,ou=People,dc=red,dc=sun,dc=com`). In this case, the broker
extracts the value of the `imq.user.repository.lpdap.uidatr` attribute
from the DN username, and uses this value as the user name in access
control operations (see link:#aeofu[User Authorization]).
* If you want the broker to use a secure, encrypted SSL (Secure Socket
Layer) connection for communicating with the LDAP server, set the
broker's `imq.user_repository.ldap.ssl.enabled` property to `true` +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.user_repository.ldap.ssl.enabled =true
----
and the `imq.user_repository.ldap.server` property to the port used by
the LDAP server for SSL communication: for example, +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.user_repository.ldap.server=myhost:7878
----
You will also need to activate SSL communication in the LDAP server.

In addition, you may need to edit the user and group names in the
broker's access control file to match those defined in the LDAP user
repository; see link:#aeofu[User Authorization] for more information.

For example, to create administrative users, you use the access control
file to specify those users and groups in the LDAP directory that can
create `ADMIN` connections.

Any user or group that can create an `ADMIN` connection can issue
administrative commands.

Using JAAS-Based Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) API allows you
to plug an external authentication mechanism into Message Queue. This
section describes the information that the Message Queue message broker
makes available to a JAAS-compliant authentication service and explains
how to configure the broker to use such a service. The following sources
provide further information on JAAS:

* For complete information about the JAAS API , see the
http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jaas/JAASRefGuide.html[Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) Reference Guide].
* For information about writing a JAAS login module, see the
http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jaas/JAASLMDevGuide.html[Java
Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) LoginModule Developer's
Guide].

JAAS is a core API in Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE), and is therefore
an integral part of Message Queue's runtime environment. It defines an
abstraction layer between an application and an authentication
mechanism, allowing the desired mechanism to be plugged in with no
change to application code. In the case of the Message Queue service,
the abstraction layer lies between the broker (application) and an
authentication provider. By setting a few broker properties, it is
possible to plug in any JAAS-compliant authentication service and to
upgrade this service with no disruption or change to broker code.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

You cannot use the Java Management Extensions (JMX) API to change
JAAS-related broker properties. However, once JAAS-based authentication
is configured, JMX client applications (like other clients) can be
authenticated using this mechanism.

Elements of JAAS
++++++++++++++++

link:#gepft[Figure 9-2] shows the basic elements of JAAS: a JAAS client,
a JAAS-compliant authentication service, and a JAAS configuration file.

* The JAAS client is an application wishing to perform authentication
using a JAAS-compliant authentication service. The JAAS client
communicates with the authentication service using one or more login
modules and is responsible for providing a callback handler that the
login module can call to obtain the user name, password, and other
information needed for authentication.
* The JAAS-compliant authentication service consists of one or more
login modules along with logic to perform the needed authentication. The
login module (`LoginModule`) may include the authentication logic
itself, or it may use a private protocol or API to communicate with an
external security service that provides the logic.
* The JAAS configuration file is a text file that the JAAS client uses
to locate the login module(s) to be used.

JAAS and Message Queue
++++++++++++++++++++++

link:#gepgx[Figure 9-3] shows how JAAS is used by the Message Queue
broker. It shows a more complex implementation of the JAAS model shown
in link:#gepft[Figure 9-2].

[[GMADG00022]][[gepgx]]


.*Figure 9-3 How Message Queue Uses JAAS*
image:img/to_myjaas.png[
"The figure shows how JAAS-compliant authentication is used with Message
Queue. The text that follows the figure explains its contents."]


The authentication service layer, consisting of one or more login
modules (if needed) and corresponding authentication logic, is separate
from the broker. The login modules run in the same Java virtual machine
as the broker. The broker is represented to the login module as a login
context, and communicates with the login module by means of a callback
handler that is part of the broker runtime code.

The authentication service also supplies a JAAS configuration file
containing entries that reference the login modules. The configuration
file specifies the order in which the login modules (if more than one)
are to be used and any conditions for their use. When the broker starts
up, it locates the configuration file by consulting either the Java
system property `java.security.auth.login.config` or the Java security
properties file. The broker then selects an entry in the JAAS
configuration file according to the value of the broker property
`imq.user_repository.jaas.name`. That entry specifies which login
module(s) will be used for authentication. The classes for the login
modules are found in the Message Queue external resource files
directory, `IMQ_HOMElib/ext`.

The relation between the configuration file, the login module, and the
broker is shown in the following figure. link:#ghezq[Figure 9-4].

[[GMADG00023]][[ghezq]]


.*Figure 9-4 Setting Up JAAS Support*
image:img/adm_jaasfiles.png[
"This figure shows the relationship between JAAS-related files. The text
preceding the figure explains its content."]


The fact that the broker uses a JAAS plug-in authentication service
remains completely transparent to the Message Queue client. The client
continues to connect to the broker as it did before, passing a user name
and password. In turn, the broker uses a callback handler to pass login
information to the authentication service, and the service uses the
information to authenticate the user and return the results. If
authentication succeeds, the broker grants the connection; if it fails,
the client runtime returns a JMS security exception that the client must
handle.

After the Message Queue client is authenticated, if there is further
authorization to be done, the broker proceeds as it normally would,
consulting the access control file to determine whether the
authenticated client is authorized to perform the actions it undertakes:
accessing a destination, consuming a message, browsing a queue, and so
on.

[[gepgd]][[GMADG00408]][[setting-up-jaas-compliant-authentication]]

Setting up JAAS-Compliant Authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Setting up JAAS-compliant authentication involves setting broker and
system properties to select this type of authentication, to specify the
location of the configuration file, and to specify the entries to the
login modules that are going to be used.

To set up JAAS support for Message Queue, you perform the following
general steps. (These steps assume you are creating your own
authentication service.)

1.  [[CJADHCIJ]] +
Create one or more login module classes that implement the
authentication service. The JAAS callback types that the broker supports
are listed below.::
`javax.security.auth.callback.LanguageCallback`::
  The broker uses this callback to pass the authentication service the
  locale in which the broker is running. This value can be used for
  localization.
`javax.security.auth.callback.NameCallback`::
  The broker uses this callback to pass to the authentication service
  the user name specified by the Message Queue client when the
  connection was requested.
`javax.security.auth.callback.TextInputCallback`::
  The broker uses this callback to pass the value of the following
  information to the login module (authentication service) when
  requested through the TextInputCallback.getPrompt() with the following
  strings: +
  * `imq.authentication.type`: The broker authentication type in effect
  at runtime
  * `imq.accesscontrol.type`: The broker access control type in effect
  at runtime
  * `imq.authentication.clientip`: The client IP address (null if
  unavailable)
  * `imq.servicename`: The name of the connection service (`jms`,
  `ssljms`, `admin`, or `ssladmin`) being used by the client
  * `imq.servicetype`: The type of the connection service (`NORMAL` or
  `ADMIN`) being used by the client
`javax.security.auth.callback.PasswordCallback`::
  The broker uses this callback to pass to the authentication service
  the password specified by the Message Queue client when the connection
  was requested.
`javax.security.auth.callback.TextOutputCallback`::
  The broker handles this callback to provide logging service to the
  authentication service by logging the text output to the broker's log
  file. The callback's `MessageType` `ERROR,` `INFORMATION,` `WARNING`
  are mapped to the broker logging levels `ERROR,` `INFO,` `WARNING`
  respectively.
2.  Create a JAAS configuration file with entries that reference the
login module classes created in Step link:#CJADHCIJ[1] and specify the
location of this file.
3.  [[CJAFEHAC]] +
Note the name of the entry in the JAAS configuration file (that
references the login module implementation classes).
4.  Archive the classes that implement the login modules to a jar file,
and place the jar file in the Message Queue `lib/ext` directory.
5.  Set the broker configuration properties that relate to JAAS support.
These are described in link:#gepge[Table 9-4].
6.  Set the following system property (to specify the location of the
JAAS configuration file). +
`java.security.auth.login.config=`JAAS_Config_File_Location +
For example, you can specify the location when you start the broker. +
`imqbrokerd -Djava.security.auth.login.config=`JAAS_Config_File_Location +
There are other ways to specify the location of the JAAS configuration
file. For additional information, see +
`http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jaas/tutorials/LoginConfigFile.html`

The following table lists the broker properties that need to be set to
set up JAAS support.

any, in the Message Queue access control file are ignored.
|=======================================================================


[[aeofu]][[GMADG00248]][[user-authorization]]

User Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An access control file contains rules that specify which users (or
groups of users) are authorized to perform certain operations on a
message broker. These operations include the following:

* Creating a connection
* Creating a message producer for a physical destination
* Creating a message consumer for a physical destination
* Browsing a queue destination
* Auto-creating a physical destination

If access control is enabled (that is, if the broker's
`imq.accesscontrol.enabled` configuration property is set to `true`, the
broker will consult its access control file whenever a client attempts
one of these operations, to verify whether the user generating the
request (or a group to which the user belongs) is authorized to perform
the operation. By editing this file, you can restrict access to these
operations to particular users and groups. Changes take effect
immediately; there is no need to restart the broker after editing the
file.

[[aeofv]][[GMADG00552]][[access-control-file-syntax]]

Access Control File Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each broker has it own access control file, created automatically when
the broker is started. The file is named `accesscontrol.properties` and
is located at `IMQ_VARHOME/instances/`instanceName`/etc`.

The file is formatted as a Java properties file. It starts with a
`version` property defining the version of the file:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
version=JMQFileAccessControlModel/100 
----

This is followed by three sections specifying the access control for
three categories of operations:

* Creating connections
* Creating message producers or consumers, or browsing a queue
destination
* Auto-creating physical destinations

Each of these sections consists of a sequence of authorization rules
specifying which users or groups are authorized to perform which
specific operations. These rules have the following syntax:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
resourceType.resourceVariant.operation.access.principalType=principals
----

link:#gbnjc[Table 9-5] describes the various elements.

Type of resource to which the rule applies:

* `connection`: Connections
* `queue`: Queue destinations
* `topic`: Topic destinations

|resourceVariant a|
Specific resource (connection service type or destination) to which the
rule applies

An asterisk (`*`) may be used as a wild-card character to denote all
resources of a given type: for example, a rule beginning with `queue.*`
applies to all queue destinations.

|operation a|
Operation to which the rule applies

This syntax element is not used for resourceType=`connection`.

|access a|
Level of access authorized:

* `allow`: Authorize user to perform operation
* `deny`: Prohibit user from performing operation

An asterisk (`*`) may be used as a wild-card character to denote all
users or all groups: for example, a rule ending with `user=*` applies to
all users.

[[aeofx]][[GMADG00553]][[application-of-authorization-rules]]

Application of Authorization Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authorization rules in the access control file are applied according to
the following principles:

* Any operation not explicitly authorized through an authorization rule
is implicitly prohibited. For example, if the access control file
contains no authorization rules, all users are denied access to all
operations.
* Authorization rules for specific users override those applying
generically to all users. For example, the rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
queue.q1.produce.allow.user=*
queue.q1.produce.deny.user=Snoopy
----
authorize all users except `Snoopy` to send messages to queue
destination `q1`.
* Authorization rules for a specific user override those for any group
to which the user belongs. For example, if user `Snoopy` is a member of
group `user`, the rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
queue.q1.consume.allow.group=user
queue.q1.consume.deny.user=Snoopy
----
authorize all members of `user` except `Snoopy` to receive messages from
queue destination `q1`.
* Authorization rules applying generically to all users override those
applying to all groups. For example, the rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
topic.t1.produce.deny.group=*
topic.t1.produce.allow.user=*
----
authorize all users to publish messages to topic destination `t1`,
overriding the rule denying such access to all groups.
* Authorization rules for specific resources override those applying
generically to all resources of a given type. For example, the rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
topic.*.consume.allow.user=Snoopy
topic.t1.consume.deny.user=Snoopy
----
authorize `Snoopy` to subscribe to all topic destinations except `t1`.
* Authorization rules authorizing and denying access to the same
resource and operation for the same user or group cancel each other out,
resulting in authorization being denied. For example, the rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
queue.q1.browse.deny.user=Snoopy
queue.q1.browse.allow.user=Snoopy
----
prevent `Snoopy` from browsing queue `q1`. The rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
topic.t1.consume.deny.group=user
topic.t1.consume.allow.group=user
----
prevent all members of group `user` from subscribing to topic `t1`.
* When multiple authorization rules are specified for the same resource,
operation, and principal type, only the last rule applies. The rules +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
queue.q1.browse.allow.user=Snoopy,Linus
queue.q1.browse.allow.user=Snoopy
----
authorize user `Snoopy`, but not `Linus`, to browse queue destination
`q1`.

[[aeofy]][[GMADG00554]][[authorization-rules-for-connection-services]]

Authorization Rules for Connection Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authorization rules with the resource type `connection` control access
to the broker's connection services. The rule's resourceVariant element
specifies the service type of the connection services to which the rule
applies, as shown in link:connection-services.html#gbnjw[Table 6-1]; the
only possible values are `NORMAL` or `ADMIN`. There is no operation
element.

The default access control file contains the rules

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
connection.NORMAL.allow.user=*
connection.ADMIN.allow.group=admin
----

giving all users access to `NORMAL` connection services (`jms`,
`ssljms`, `httpjms`, and `httpsjms`) and those in the `admin` group
access to `ADMIN` connection services (`admin` and `ssladmin`). You can
then add additional authorization rules to restrict the connection
access privileges of specific users: for example, the rule

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
connection.NORMAL.deny.user=Snoopy
----

denies user `Snoopy` access privileges for connection services of type
`NORMAL`.

If you are using a file-based user repository, the `admin` user group is
created by the User Manager utility. If access control is disabled
(`imq.accesscontrol.enabled` = `false`), all users in the `admin` group
automatically have connection privileges for `ADMIN` connection
services. If access control is enabled, access to these services is
controlled by the authorization rules in the access control file.

If you are using an LDAP user repository, you must define your own user
groups in the LDAP directory, using the tools provided by your LDAP
vendor. You can either define a group named `admin`, which will then be
governed by the default authorization rule shown above, or edit the
access control file to refer to one or more other groups that you have
defined in the LDAP directory. You must also explicitly enable access
control by setting the broker's `imq.accesscontrol.enabled` property to
`true`.

[[aeofz]][[GMADG00555]][[authorization-rules-for-physical-destinations]]

Authorization Rules for Physical Destinations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Access to specific physical destinations on the broker is controlled by
authorization rules with a resource type of `queue` or `topic`, as the
case may be. These rules regulate access to the following operations:

* Sending messages to a queue: produce operation
* Receiving messages from a queue: consume operation
* Publishing messages to a topic: produce operation
* Subscribing to and consuming messages from a topic: consume operation
* Browsing a queue: browse operation

By default, all users and groups are authorized to perform all of these
operations on any physical destination. You can change this by editing
the default authorization rules in the access control properties file or
overriding them with more specific rules of your own. For example, the
rule

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
topic.Admissions.consume.deny.group=user
----

denies all members of the `user` group the ability to subscribe to the
topic `Admissions`.

[[gjmsn]][[GMADG00409]][[authorization-rules-for-auto-created-physical-destinations]]

Authorization Rules for Auto-Created Physical Destinations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a client creates a message producer or consumer for a physical
destination that does not already exist, the broker will auto-create the
destination (provided that the broker's `imq.autocreate.queue` or
`imq.autocreate.topic` property is set to `true`).

The final section of the access control file controls the ability of
users and groups to auto-create destinations, and to access any
auto-created destinations. This is governed by authorization rules with
a resourceType of `queue` or `topic` and an operation element of
`create`. the resourceVariant element is omitted, since these rules
apply to all auto-created queues or all auto-created topics, rather than
any specific destination.

The default access control file contains the rules

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
queue.create.allow.user=*
topic.create.allow.user=*
----

authorizing all users to have physical destinations auto-created for
them by the broker, and to have access to any auto-created destinations.
You can edit the file to restrict such authorization for specific users.
For example, the rule

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
topic.create.deny.user=Snoopy
----

denies user `Snoopy` the ability to auto-create topic destinations or to
access any auto-created topic destinations.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The effect of such auto-creation rules must be congruent with that of
other physical destination access rules. For example, if you change the
destination authorization rule to prohibit any user from sending a
message to a queue, but enable the auto-creation of queue destinations,
the broker will create the physical destination if it does not exist,
but will not deliver a message to it.

=======================================================================


[[aeogb]][[GMADG00249]][[message-encryption]]

Message Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section explains how to set up a connection service based on the
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) standard, which enables delivery of encrypted
messages over the connection. Message Queue supports the following
SSL-based connection services:

* The `ssljms` service delivers secure, encrypted messages between a
client and a broker, using the TCP/IP transport protocol.
* The `httpsjms` service delivers secure, encrypted messages between a
client and a broker, using an HTTPS tunnel servlet with the HTTP
transport protocol.
* The `ssladmin` service creates a secure, encrypted connection between
the Message Queue Command utility (`imqcmd`) and a broker, using the
TCP/ IP transport protocol. Encrypted connections are not supported for
the Administration Console (`imqadmin`).
* The `cluster` connection service is used internally to provide secure,
encrypted communication between brokers in a cluster, using the TCP/IP
transport protocol.
* A JMX connector that supports secure, encrypted communication between
a JMX client and a broker's MBean server using the RMI transport
protocol over TCP.

The remainder of this section describes how to set up secure connections
over TCP/IP, using the `ssljms`, `ssladmin`, and `cluster` connection
services. For information on setting up secure connections over HTTP
with the `httpsjms` service, see
link:http_https-support.html#aeopb[HTTP/HTTPS Support].

[[aeogd]][[GMADG00556]][[using-self-signed-certificates]]

Using Self-Signed Certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use an SSL-based connection service over TCP /IP, you generate a
public/private key pair using the Key Tool utility (`imqkeytool`). This
utility embeds the public key in a self-signed certificate that is
passed to any client requesting a connection to the broker, and the
client uses the certificate to set up an encrypted connection. This
section describes how to set up an SSL-based service using such
self-signed certificates.

For a stronger level of authentication, you can use signed certificates
verified by a certification authority. The use of signed certificates
involves some additional steps beyond those needed for self-signed
certificates: you must first perform the procedures described in this
section and then perform the additional steps in link:#aeogk[Using
Signed Certificates].

Message Queue's support for SSL with self-signed certificates is
oriented toward securing on-the-wire data, on the assumption that the
client is communicating with a known and trusted server. Configuring SSL
with self-signed certificates requires configuration on both the broker
and client:

* link:#ggwkm[Setting Up an SSL-Based Connection Service Using
Self-Signed Certificates]
* link:#aeogh[Configuring and Running an SSL-Based Client Using
Self-Signed Certificates]

[[ggwkm]][[GMADG00410]][[setting-up-an-ssl-based-connection-service-using-self-signed-certificates]]

Setting Up an SSL-Based Connection Service Using Self-Signed Certificates
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following sequence of procedures are needed to set up an SSL-based
connection service for using self-signed certificates:


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Starting with release 4.0, the default value for the client connection
factory property `imqSSLIsHostTrusted` is `false`. If your application
depends on the prior default value of `true`, you need to reconfigure
and to set the property explicitly to `true`. In particular, old or new
clients using self-signed certificates should set this property to true;
for example:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java -DimqConnectionType=TLS -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true MyApp
----

The administration tool `imqcmd` is also affected by this change. In
addition to using the `-secure` option to specify that it uses a
SSL-based `admin` connection service, the `imqSSLIsHostTrusted` should
be set to `true` when connecting to a broker configured with a
self-signed certificate. You can do this as follows:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc -secure -DimqSSLIsHostTrusted=true
----

Alternatively, you can import the broker's self-signed certificate into
the client runtime trust store. Use the procedure in link:#gbnjz[To
Install a Signed Certificate].

=======================================================================


1.  Generate a self-signed certificate.
2.  Enable the desired SSL-based connection services in the broker.
These can include the `ssljms`, `ssladmin`, or `cluster` connection
services.
3.  Start the broker.

[[ggwgc]][[GMADG00166]][[to-generate-a-self-signed-certificate]]

To Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

Run the Key Tool utility (`imqkeytool`) to generate a self-signed
certificate for the broker. (On Solaris and Linux operating systems, you
may need to run the utility as the root user in order to have permission
to create the keystore file.) The same certificate can be used for all
SSL-based connection services (`ssljms`, `ssladmin`, `cluster`
connection services, and the `ssljmxrmi` connector).

1.  Enter the following at the command prompt: +
`imqkeytool` `broker` +
The Key Tool utility prompts you for a key store password:
2.  At the prompt type a keystore password. +

3.  Accept the current values and proceed by typing `yes`. +
To reenter values, accept the default or enter `no`. After you confirm,
the utility pauses while it generates a key pair. +
The utility asks for a password to lock the key pair (key password).
4.  Press return. +
This will set the same password for both the key password and the
keystore password. +

[CAUTION]
=======================================================================

Be sure to remember the password you specify. You must provide this
password when you start the broker, to allow the broker to open the
keystore file. You can store the keystore password in a password file
(see link:#aeogq[Password Files]).

=======================================================================

The Key Tool utility generates a self-signed certificate and places it
in Message Queue's keystore file. The keystore file is located in
`IMQ_HOME/etc` by default. +
The following are the configurable properties for the Message Queue
keystore for SSL-based connection services:::
`imq.keystore.file.dirpath`::
  Path to directory containing keystore file
`imq.keystore.file.name`::
  Name of key store file
`imq.keystore.password`::
  Ke store password (to be used only in a password file) +
In some circumstances, you may need to regenerate a key pair in order to
solve certain problems: for example, if you forget the key store
password or if the SSL-based service fails to initialize when you start
a broker and you get the exception: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException: Cannot recover key 
----
(This exception may result if you provided a key password different from
the keystore password when you generated the self-signed certificate.)

[[ggwhw]][[GMADG00167]][[to-regenerate-a-key-pair]]

To Regenerate a Key Pair

1.  Remove the broker's keystore file. +
The file is located in `IMQ_HOME/etc` by default.
2.  Run `imqkeytool` again. +
The command will generate a new key pair, as described above.

To Enable an SSL-Based Connection Service in the Broker

To enable an SSL-based connection service in the broker, you need to add
the corresponding service or services to the `imq.service.activelist`
property.

1.  Open the broker's instance configuration file: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----

2.  Add an entry (if one does not already exist) for the
`imq.service.activelist` property and include the desired SSL-based
service(s) in the list. +
By default, the property includes the `jms` and `admin` connection
services. Add the SSL-based service or services you wish to activate
(`ssljms`, `ssladmin`, or both): +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

The SSL-based `cluster` connection service is enabled using the
`imq.cluster.transport` property rather than the
`imq.service.activelist` property (see
link:broker-clusters.html#ggumd[Cluster Connection Service Properties]).
To enable SSL for RMI-based JMX connectors, see
link:jmx-support.html#ggvun[SSL-Based JMX Connections].

To Start the Broker

Start the broker, providing the key store password.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

When you start a broker or client with SSL, you may notice a sharp
increase in CPU usage for a few seconds. This is because the JSSE (Java
Secure Socket Extension) method `java.security.SecureRandom`, which
Message Queue uses to generate random numbers, takes a significant
amount of time to create the initial random number seed. Once the seed
is created, the CPU usage level will drop to normal.

=======================================================================


1.  Start the broker, providing the keystore password. +
Put the keystore password in a password file, as described in
link:#aeogq[Password Files] and set the `imq.passfile.enabled` property
to `true`. You can now do one of the following:
* Pass the location of the password file to the `imqbrokerd` command: +
`imqbrokerd -passfile /`passfileDirectory`/`passfileName
* Start the broker without the `-passfile` option, but specify the
location of the password file using the following two broker
configuration properties: +
`imq.passfile.dirpath=/`passfileDirectory +
`imq.passfile.name=/`passfileName
2.  If you are not using a password file, enter the keystore password at

Configuring and Running an SSL-Based Client Using Self-Signed Certificates
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The procedure for configuring a client to use an SSL-based connection
service differs depending on whether it is an application client (using
the `ssljms` connection service) or a Message Queue administrative
client such as `imqcmd` (using the `ssladmin` connection service.)

[[gctub]][[GMADG00079]][[application-clients]]

Application Clients

For application clients, you must make sure the client has the following
`.jar` files specified in its `CLASSPATH` variable:

`imq.jar` +
`jms.jar`

Once the `CLASSPATH` files are properly specified, one way to start the
client and connect to the broker's `ssljms` connection service is by
entering a command like the following:

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
java  -DimqConnectionType=TLS clientAppName
----

This tells the connection to use an SSL-based connection service.

[[aeogj]][[GMADG00080]][[administrative-clients]]

Administrative Clients

For administrative clients, you can establish a secure connection by
including the `-secure` option when you invoke the `imqcmd` command: for
example,

[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqcmd list svc  -b hostName:portNumber  -u userName  -secure
----

where userName is a valid `ADMIN` entry in the Message Queue user
repository. The command will prompt you for the password.

Listing the connection services is a way to verify that the `ssladmin`
service is running and that you can successfully make a secure
administrative connection, as shown in link:#gevuc[Example 9-6].

Using Signed Certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Signed certificates provide a stronger level of server authentication
than self-signed certificates. You can implement signed certificates
only between a client and broker, and currently not between multiple
brokers in a cluster. This requires the following extra procedures in
addition to the ones described in link:#aeogd[Using Self-Signed
Certificates]. Using signed certificates requires configuration on both
the broker and client:

* link:#aeogl[Obtaining and Installing a Signed Certificate]
* link:#aeogm[Configuring the Client to Require Signed Certificates]

[[aeogl]][[GMADG00412]][[obtaining-and-installing-a-signed-certificate]]

Obtaining and Installing a Signed Certificate
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following procedures explain how to obtain and install a signed
certificate.

[[gbnjh]][[GMADG00170]][[to-obtain-a-signed-certificate]]

To Obtain a Signed Certificate

1.  Use the J2SE `keytool` command to generate a certificate signing
request (CSR) for the self-signed certificate you generated in the
preceding section. +
Information about the `keytool` command can be found at
* `http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html` +
Here is an example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -certreq  -keyalg RSA  -alias imq  -file certreq.csr
-keystore /etc/imq/keystore  -storepass  myStorePassword
----
This generates a CSR encapsulating the certificate in the specified file
(`certreq.csr` in the example).
2.  Use the CSR to generate or request a signed certificate. +
You can do this by either of the following methods:
* Have the certificate signed by a well known certification authority
(CA), such as Thawte or Verisign. See your CA's documentation for more
information on how to do this.
* Sign the certificate yourself, using an SSL signing software package. +
The resulting signed certificate is a sequence of ASCII characters. If
you receive the signed certificate from a CA, it may arrive as an e-mail
attachment or in the text of a message.
3.  Save the signed certificate in a file. +
The instructions below use the example name `broker.cer` to represent
the broker certificate.

[[gbnjz]][[GMADG00171]][[to-install-a-signed-certificate]]

To Install a Signed Certificate

1.  Check whether J2SE supports your certification authority by default. +
The following command lists the root CAs in the system key store: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -v  -list  -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts
----
If your CA is listed, skip the next step.
2.  If your certification authority is not supported in J2SE, import the
CA's root certificate into the Message Queue key store. +
Here is an example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -import  -alias ca  -file ca.cer  -noprompt  -trustcacerts
-keystore /etc/imq/keystore  -storepass  myStorePassword
----
where `ca.cer` is the file containing the root certificate obtained from
the CA. +
If you are using a CA test certificate, you probably need to import the
test CA root certificate. Your CA should have instructions on how to
obtain a copy.
3.  Import the signed certificate into the key store to replace the
original self-signed certificate. +
Here is an example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -import  -alias imq  -file broker.cer  -noprompt  -trustcacerts
-keystore /etc/imq/keystore  -storepass  myStorePassword
----
where `broker.cer` is the file containing the signed certificate that
you received from the CA. +
The Message Queue key store now contains a signed certificate to use for
SSL connections.

[[aeogm]][[GMADG00413]][[configuring-the-client-to-require-signed-certificates]]

Configuring the Client to Require Signed Certificates
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must now configure the Message Queue client runtime to require
signed certificates, and ensure that it trusts the certification
authority that signed the certificate.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

By default, starting with release 4.0, the connection factory object
that the client will be using to establish broker connections has its
`imqSSLIsHostTrusted` attribute set to `false`, meaning that the client
runtime will attempt to validate all certificates. Validation will fail
if the signer of the certificate is not in the client's trust store.

=======================================================================


[[gbnjn]][[GMADG00172]][[to-configure-the-client-runtime-to-require-signed-certificates]]

To Configure the Client Runtime to Require Signed Certificates

1.  Verify whether the signing authority is registered in the client's
trust store. +
To test whether the client will accept certificates signed by your
certification authority, try to establish an SSL connection, as
described above under link:#aeogh[Configuring and Running an SSL-Based
Client Using Self-Signed Certificates]. If the CA is in the client's
trust store, the connection will succeed and you can skip the next step.
If the connection fails with a certificate validation error, go on to
the next step.
2.  Install the signing CA's root certificate in the client's trust
store. +
The client searches the key store files `cacerts` and `jssecacerts` by
default, so no further configuration is necessary if you install the
certificate in either of those files. The following example installs a
test root certificate from the Verisign certification authority from a
file named `testrootca.cer` into the default system certificate file,
`cacerts`. The example assumes that J2SE is installed in the directory
`$JAVA_HOME/usr/j2se`: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -import  -keystore /usr/j2se/jre/lib/security/cacerts 
-alias VerisignTestCA  -file testrootca.cer  -noprompt
-trustcacerts  -storepass myStorePassword 
----
An alternative (and recommended) option is to install the root
certificate into the alternative system certificate file, `jssecacerts`: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -import  -keystore /usr/j2se/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts 
-alias VerisignTestCA  -file testrootca.cer  -noprompt
-trustcacerts  -storepass myStorePassword 
----
A third possibility is to install the root certificate into some other
key store file and configure the client to use that as its trust store.
The following example installs into the file `/home/smith/.keystore`: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
keytool  -import  -keystore /home/smith/.keystore 
-alias VerisignTestCA  -file testrootca.cer  -noprompt
-trustcacerts  -storepass myStorePassword 
----
Since the client does not search this key store by default, you must
explicitly provide its location to the client to use as a trust store.
You do this by setting the Java system property
`javax.net.ssl.trustStore` once the client is running: +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/smith/.keystore 
----

Password Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several types of command require passwords. In link:#gbnjx[Table 9-6],
the first column lists the commands that require passwords and the
second column lists the reason that passwords are needed.

|`imqcmd` |Manage broker |Authenticate an administrative user who is
authorized to use the command

|`imqdbmgr` |Manage JDBC-based data store |Access the data store

You can specify these passwords in a password file and use the
`-passfile` option to specify the name of the file. This is the format
for the `-passfile` option:

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In previous versions of Message Queue, you could use the `-p`,
`-password`, `-dbpassword`, and `-ldappassword` options to specify
passwords on the command line. As of Message Queue 4.0, these options
are deprecated and are no longer supported; you must use a password file
instead.

=======================================================================


[[aeogr]][[GMADG00558]][[security-considerations-for-passwords-and-password-files]]

Security Considerations for Passwords and Password Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Typing a password interactively, in response to a prompt, is the most
secure method of specifying a password (provided that your monitor is
not visible to other people). You can also specify a password file on
the command line. For non-interactive use of commands, however, you must
use a password file.

A password file that contains clear passwords should be obfusticated
using `imqusermgr encode`. An obfusticated password file must be stored
in location that allows you to set directory and file permissions to
protect them from unauthorized access. Set the permissions so that they
limit the users who can view the file, but provide read access to the
user who starts the broker.


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

Oracle recommends using `imqusermgr encode` to obfuscate passfiles. See
link:#CJAIJHAJ[Secure Password Files].

=======================================================================

Secure Password Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Message Queue 5.0, Oracle provides User Manager utility
(`imqusermgr`) commands to obfuscate (convert to an unreadable format)
password files (passfiles).

[[CJAJGGBD]][[GMADG820]][[obfuscate-a-passfile]]

Obfuscate a Passfile
++++++++++++++++++++

To obfuscate a password file:

1.  Place all password property name`=`value pairs in a password file.
See link:#aeogs[Password File Contents].
2.  Use `imqusermgr encode` to obfuscate the password file to a new
password file. See link:command-line-reference.html#aeonp[User Manager
Utility]. +
For example:
`imqusermgr encode -src IMQ_HOME/etc/passfile.clear -target IMQ_HOME/etc/passfile.secure`
3.  Use the new password file for commands that require those passwords.
For example: +
[source,oac_no_warn]

To add a new password to an existing password file:

1.  Add the new name`=`value pair to an existing passfile (clear text or
obfuscated).
2.  Use `imqusermgr encode` to obfuscate the password file. See
link:#CJAJGGBD[Obfuscate a Passfile].

[[GMADG822]][[sthref38]]


[[delete-a-password-from-a-password-file]]

2.  Add a new line containing the new password.
3.  Use `imqusermgr encode` to obfuscate the password file. See
link:#CJAJGGBD[Obfuscate a Passfile].

[[GMADG824]][[sthref40]]


[[deobfuscate-a-password-file]]
Deobfuscate a Password File
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To convert an obfuscated passfile to clear text, use
`imqusermgr decode`. See link:command-line-reference.html#aeonp[User
Manager Utility].For example:

`imqusermgr decode -src IMQ_HOME/etc/passfile.secure -target IMQ_HOME/etc/passfile.clear`

[[GMADG825]][[sthref41]]


[[upgrading-clear-text-password-files]]
Upgrading Clear Text Password Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Although using clear text passfiles is still supported in this release
of Message Queue, Oracle recommends existing clear text passfiles be
obfuscated by running `imqusermge encode`. See

A broker logs a warning message when a clear text password is found in a
password file.

[[gcuhq]][[GMADG00251]][[connecting-through-a-firewall]]

Connecting Through a Firewall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a client application is separated from the broker by a firewall,
special measures are needed in order to establish a connection. One
approach is to use the `httpjms` or `httpsjms` connection service, which
can "tunnel" through the firewall; see
link:http_https-support.html#aeopb[HTTP/HTTPS Support] for details. HTTP
connections are slower than other connection services, however; a faster
alternative is to bypass the Message Queue Port Mapper and explicitly
assign a static port address to the desired connection service, and then
open that specific port in the firewall. This approach can be used to
connect through a firewall using the `jms` or `ssljms` connection
service (or, in unusual cases, `admin` or `ssladmin`).

[[GMADG659]][[sthref42]][[gcuhp]]


Table 9-8 Broker Configuration Properties for Static Port Addresses

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]

|Connection Service |Configuration Property
|`jms` |`imq.jms.tcp.port`
|`ssljms` |`imq.ssljms.tls.port`
|`admin` |`imq.admin.tcp.port`
|`ssladmin` |`imq.ssladmin.tls.port`
|==========================================


[[gcugz]][[GMADG00173]][[to-enable-broker-connections-through-a-firewall]]

To Enable Broker Connections Through a Firewall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Assign a static port address to the connection service you wish to
use. +
To bypass the Port Mapper and assign a static port number directly to a
connection service, set the broker configuration property
`imq.`serviceName`.`protocolType`.port`, where serviceName is the name
of the connection service andprotocolType is its protocol type (see
link:#gcuhp[Table 9-8]). As with all broker configuration properties,
you can specify this property either in the broker's instance
configuration file or from the command line when starting the broker.
For example, to assign port number `10234` to the `jms` connection
service, either include the line +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imq.jms.tcp.port=10234
----
in the configuration file or start the broker with the command +
[source,oac_no_warn]
----
imqbrokerd  -name brokerName  -Dimq.jms.tcp.port=10234
----
where brokerName is the name of the broker to be started.
2.  Configure the firewall to allow connections to the port number you
assigned to the connection service. +
You must also allow connections through the firewall to Message Queue's
Port Mapper port (normally `7676`, unless you have reassigned it to some
other port). In the example above, for instance, you would need to open
the firewall for ports `10234` and `7676`.

[[aeogt]][[GMADG00252]][[audit-logging-with-the-solaris-bsm-audit-log]]

Audit Logging with the Solaris BSM Audit Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Message Queue supports audit logging. When audit logging is enabled,
Message Queue generates a record for the following types of events:

* Startup, shutdown, restart, and removal of a broker instance
* User authentication and authorization
* Reset of a persistent store
* Creation, purge, and destruction of a physical destination
* Administrative destruction of a durable subscriber

Message Queue supports logging audit records to the Message Queuebroker
log file and to the Solaris BSM audit log:

* To log audit records to the Message Queue broker log file, set the
`imq.audit.enabled` broker property to `true` . All audit records in the
broker log contain the keyword `AUDIT`.
* To log audit records to the Solaris BSM audit log, set the
`imq.audit.bsm.disabled` broker property to `false` . +

[NOTE]
=======================================================================

To log audit records to the Solaris BSM audit log, you must run the
broker as `root`, and `/usr/lib/audit/Audit.jar` must be in the broker
classpath.
