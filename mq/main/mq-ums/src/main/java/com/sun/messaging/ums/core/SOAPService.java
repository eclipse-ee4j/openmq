/**
 * MQ SOAP Service interface. This is part of the MQ SOAP Service frame work that is used to implement and provide a new
 * SOAP service in the frame work.
 *
 * <p>
 * A SOAP service consists of the following components:
 *
 * <p>
 * 1. Request Handler Chain. The Request handler can be registered as follows in the web.xml:
 *
 * <p>
 * mq.soap.request.handler.#=MessageHandler class full name.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example,
 *
 * <p>
 * mq.soap.request.handler.1=com.sun.TestMessageListener1
 * <p>
 * mq.soap.request.handler.2=com.sun.TestMessageListener2
 *
 * <P>
 * 2. Response Handler Chain. The Response handler can be registered as follows in the web.xml:
 *
 * <p>
 * mq.soap.response.handler.#=MessageHandler class full name.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example,
 *
 * <P>
 * mq.soap.response.handler.1=com.sun.TestMessageListener1
 * <p>
 * mq.soap.response.handler.2=com.sun.TestMessageListener2
 *
 * <p>
 * 3. ReqRespListener onMessage() implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * 4. Service lifecycle management methods. There are four methods defined for life cycle management -
 * init/start/stop/close. They are used for init/start/stop/close a MQ SOAP Service instance. Sub class SHOULD implement
 * or over ride the life cycle methods if necessary.
 *
 *
 * <p>
 * MQSOAPService is a class that provides base implementation of SOApService interface. A new SOAP service is
 * recommended to sub class MQSOAPService and over ride appropriate methods as needed. Please see MQSOAPService Javadoc
 * for details.
