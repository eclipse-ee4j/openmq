Provides the API for using a messaging provider to send and receive
SOAP messages. This package is specified in the 
<i>Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> API for XML Messaging (JAXM)
1.1</i> specification.
<P>
A client using Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
API for XML Messaging technology ("JAXM client") makes its connections
to a messaging provider, which means that 
all messages it sends or receives go through the provider.  
The messaging provider is responsible for the delivery of messages,
performing many functions behind the scenes.  With a messaging provider, it
is possible to send a message to multiple destinations, and a messaging
provider can be configured to do the following:
<UL>
  <LI>maintain a list of endpoints to which messages will be sent
  <LI>send, and if necessary, resend a message until the message is delivered 
	 successfully or until the specified limit for retries is reached 
  <LI>log messages in a specified directory
</UL>
In addition, a messaging provider can make it possible for a protocol such
as ebXML or SOAP RP to operate on top of SOAP, extending the Quality of
Service available to JAXM messages.
<P>
The API in the <code>javax.xml.messaging</code> package makes it
possible to do one-way messaging.  
One-way messaging allows the client to send a message
and immediately go on to other work because the
response, if there is one, will be sent as a separate operation at
some time in the future.
<P>
The <code>javax.xml.messaging</code> package must always work in conjunction
with the <code>jakarta.xml.soap</code> package, which provides the
API for constructing SOAP messages and retreiving their content.
(The <code>jakarta.xml.soap</code> package is
defined in the <i>SOAP with Attachments API for
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> (SAAJ) 1.1</i> specification.)

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The JAXM 1.1 specification includes an overview of the
<code>javax.xml.messaging</code> package and
explains how its classes and interfaces work.
