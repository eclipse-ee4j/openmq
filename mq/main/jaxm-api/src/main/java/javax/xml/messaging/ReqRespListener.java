/**
 * A marker interface for components that are intended to be consumers of request-response messages. In the
 * request-response style of messaging, sending a request and receiving the response are both done in a single
 * operation. This means that the client sending the request cannot do anything else until after it has received the
 * response.
 * <P>
 * From the standpoint of the sender, a message is sent via the <code>SOAPConnection</code> method <code>call</code> in
 * a point-to-point fashion. The method <code>call</code> blocks, waiting until it gets a response message that it can
 * return. The sender may be a standalone client, or it may be deployed in a container.
 * <P>
 * The receiver, typically a service operating in a servlet, implements the <code>ReqRespListener</code> method
 * <code>onMessage</code> to specify how to respond to the requests it receives.
 * <P>
 * It is possible that a standalone client might use the method <code>call</code> to send a message that does not
 * require a response. For such cases, the receiver must implement the method <code>onMessage</code> such that it
 * returns a message whose only purpose is to unblock the <code>call</code> method.
