/**
 * This class is a mostly immutable encapsulation of a JMQ packet. It is only "mostly" immutable because it can be
 * modified by calling the readPacket() method which modifies the state of the object to reflect the packet just read.
 *
 * WARNING! This class emphasizes performance over safety. In particular the readPacket() method is NOT synchronized.
 * You must only call readPacket() in a single threaded environment (or do the synchronization yourself). Once the
 * object is initialized via a readPacket() you can safely use the accessors and the writePacket() methods in a
 * multi-threaded envornment.
