/**
 * This class defines the decoding half of character encoders. A character decoder is an algorithim for transforming 8
 * bit binary data that has been encoded into text by a character encoder, back into original binary form.
 *
 * The character encoders, in general, have been structured around a central theme that binary data can be encoded into
 * text that has the form:
 *
 * <pre>
 *	[Buffer Prefix]
 *	[Line Prefix][encoded data atoms][Line Suffix]
 *	[Buffer Suffix]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Of course in the simplest encoding schemes, the buffer has no distinct prefix of suffix, however all have some fixed
 * relationship between the text in an 'atom' and the binary data itself.
 *
 * In the CharacterEncoder and CharacterDecoder classes, one complete chunk of data is referred to as a <i>buffer</i>.
 * Encoded buffers are all text, and decoded buffers (sometimes just referred to as buffers) are binary octets.
 *
 * To create a custom decoder, you must, at a minimum, overide three abstract methods in this class.
 * <DL>
 * <DD>bytesPerAtom which tells the decoder how many bytes to expect from decodeAtom
 * <DD>decodeAtom which decodes the bytes sent to it as text.
 * <DD>bytesPerLine which tells the encoder the maximum number of bytes per line.
 * </DL>
 *
 * Several useful decoders have already been written and are referenced in the See Also list below.
 *
 * @see CharacterEncoder
 * @see BASE64Decoder
