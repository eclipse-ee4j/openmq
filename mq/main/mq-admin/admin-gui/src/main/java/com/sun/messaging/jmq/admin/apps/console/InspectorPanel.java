/**
 * This InspectorPanel class is the superclass of all inspector panels used to inspect objects in the JMQ Administration
 * GUI.
 *
 * <P>
 * The collection of classes that subclass InspectorPanel are used in the AInspector class to display the attributes of
 * a specified ConsoleObj object.
 *
 * <P>
 * Each ConsoleObj object contains information (i.e. classname) that specifies which InspectorPanel to use to
 * <EM>inspect</EM> it within the AInspector class. The AInspector class is a container for all the InspectorPanels used
 * in the console application.
 *
 * <P>
 * The InspectorPanel class provides the following features:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>allow subclass to create their GUI content via the <STRONG>createWorkPanel()</STRONG> method.
 * <LI>provide method for accessing currently inspected object via <STRONG>getConsoleObj()</STRONG> method.
 * <LI>provide hooks for initializing the panel for the specific ConsoleObj that is being inspected, via the
 * <STRONG>inspectorInit()</STRONG> method.
 * <LI>provide method for firing off events, via the <STRONG>fireAdminEventDispatched</STRONG> method.
 * <LI>provide hooks for deselecting objects in the InspectorPanel GUI, via the <STRONG>clearSelection</STRONG> method.
 * This method will be invoked by the containing AInspector class whenever objects displayed in the InspectorPanel class
 * needs to be deselected.
 * </UL>
 *
 * When a ConsoleObj object is inspected (in the AInspector class), it's InspectorPanel is instantiated (if not already
 * done), and the inspector panel's inspectConsoleObj() method is invoked, passing in the object to inspect as well as
 * an event listeners list which is used when events need to be dispatched.
