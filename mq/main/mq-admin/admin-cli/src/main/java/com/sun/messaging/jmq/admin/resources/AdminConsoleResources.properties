#
# NOTE ON USING '\'es:
# The trailing '\' on a line is the line continuation character.
# The leading '\' at the start of a line escapes the first space in that
# line so the leading whitespace is not lost
#
# NOTE ON USING ''
# If a message contains parameters (e.g. {0}, {1}, etc), you *MUST*
# escape single quotes by doubling them up (''). If the message does
# not contain parameters then do not double them up (').
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES TO TRANSLATORS:
#  1. If a message spans multiple lines, you must terminate
#     each line (except the last) with the '\' character.
#  2. If a continued line starts with whitespace you must begin
#     the line with the '\' character in the first column.
#  3. If a message contains a parameter (ie {0}, {1}, etc) you
#     must escape single quotes by doubling them up (''). I.e.
#       Could not start the Broker''s {0} service on port {1}.\n

#
# Notes for bugfix
# 5017152:
#  The same resource key is used for both menu item label and dialog 
#  box title.
#
# We used to use the same strings for some menu items and other 
# things like tooltips and dialog titles. The localization centers 
# requested we separate them because the menu items need to have 
# extra characters in parantheses to support mnemonics. This is due
# to the fact that mnemonics need to be 'simple' characters and not
# a complex Asian character. For example, the menu item may look
# like:
#         XXX (A)
# and 'A' would be the assigned mnemonic.
# 
# The above menu string makes an ugly dialog title or tooltip - which 
# is why we don't share such strings any more. Now we will have 
# separate keys for menu item labels and strings that can be used in 
# places like dialog titles. 
#
# The affected keys are:
# Menu labels:
#  A1000 - A1038, A1106, A1115 - A1118, A1505
#   - these keys can have strings of the form:
#		XXX (A)
#   - these keys are spread across this file and will be marked with 
#     'MENU LABELS BEGIN' and 'MENU LABELS END'.
# 
# Equivalent non menu labels:
#  A1120 - A1159
#   - these keys are the equivalent strings as the ones above,
#     but for non menu usage. They should not have the "(A)"
#     part as the strings above.
#   - these keys are grouped together (at least for now) and
#     are marked with 'NON-MENU LABELS BEGIN'/'NON-MENU LABELS END'.
