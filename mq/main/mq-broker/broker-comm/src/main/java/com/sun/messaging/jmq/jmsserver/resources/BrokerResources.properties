# This file contains localizations for the MQ Broker.
#
# NOTE ON USING '\'es:
# The trailing '\' on a line is the line continuation character.
# The leading '\' at the start of a line escapes the first space in that
# line so the leading whitespace is not lost
#
# NOTE ON USING ''
# If a message contains parameters (e.g. {0}, {1}, etc), you *MUST*
# escape single quotes by doubling them up (''). If the message does
# not contain parameters then do not double them up (').
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES TO TRANSLATORS:
#  1. If a message spans multiple lines, you must terminate
#     each line (except the last) with the '\' character.
#  2. If a continued line starts with whitespace you must begin
#     the line with the '\' character in the first column.
#  3. If a message contains a parameter (ie {0}, {1}, etc) you
#     must escape single quotes by doubling them up (''). I.e.
#       Could not start the Broker''s {0} service on port {1}.\n
