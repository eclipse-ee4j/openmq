 * DefaultTrustManager to manage authentication trust decisions for different types of authentication material. Here

 * X509TrustManager is an interface to manage which X509 certificates which are used to authenticate the remote side of
 * a secure socket. Decisions may be based on trusted certificate authorities, certificate revocation lists, online
 * status checking or other means.

 * Currently contains some dummy methods. This should be sufficient for the 2.0 product.
