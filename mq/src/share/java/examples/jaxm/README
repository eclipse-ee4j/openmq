JAVA(TM) API for XML MESSAGING (JAXM) CODE EXAMPLES
===================================================


Notes for use with Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue
------------------------------------------------------------

These notes describe the sample applications provided in this
directory and explain how to use them.  The examples consist of a three
JAXM SOAP messaging examples (including two servlets that receive SOAP)
along with two examples that illustrate the use of JAXM and JMS together.

A detailed guideline on configuring your enrivonment and setting CLASSPATH 
is found in the top-level README file of the examples (demo) directory of
the Message Queue installation (<IMQ_HOME>/examples/README) as well as in
the "Quick Start Tutorial" in the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue 
Developer's Guide.

The material in these notes is organized into the following sections:

1. List of example applications
2. Compiling the examples in a Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue environment
3. Assembling and deploying the servlets
4. Running the example client applications


===============================
1. List of Example Applications
===============================

The examples consist of the following:

- SOAPEchoServlet.java:

  A JAXM servlet that echoes a SOAP message.


- SOAPtoJMSServlet.java:

  A JAXM servlet that receives a SOAP message, wraps it as a JMS message
  and uses JMS to publish it to a JMS Topic destination.


- SendSOAPMessage.java:

  A standalone JAXM client that sends a SOAP message.


- SendSOAPMessageWithJMS.java:

  A standalone client that constructs a SOAP message using JAXM,
  wraps it as a JMS message, and then uses JMS to publish this message
  to a JMS Topic destination.


- ReceiveSOAPMessageWithJMS.java:

  A standalone client that uses JMS to subscribe to a JMS Topic,
  receives a JMS-wrapped SOAP message, which it then converts to a SOAP
  message.


The first two examples are servlets that consume SOAP messages - i.e. are
SOAP message 'endpoints'.
The next two examples create SOAP messages using JAXM; the first of these
sends the SOAP message using JAXM while the second converts the SOAP message
to a JMS message and sends it using JMS.
The last example receives a JMS-wrapped SOAP message which it can convert
back to a SOAP message which can be manipulated using JAXM.

The three examples that convert SOAP messages into JMS messages
(and vice-versa) take advantage of the reliable messaging and
publish and subscribe capabilities of Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue.



====================================================================================
2. Compiling the examples in a Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue Environment
====================================================================================

The examples have been pre-compiled using the 
Java 2 Standard Edition SDK version 1.5 (JDK1.5).

To compile the examples,
 - ensure that all of the following jar files are in
   your CLASSPATH -

     <IMQ_HOME>/lib/jaxm-api.jar
     <IMQ_HOME>/lib/jms.jar
     <IMQ_HOME>/lib/imq.jar
     <IMQ_HOME>/lib/imqxm.jar
     javax.xml.soap-api.jar  (http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=javax/xml/soap/javax.xml.soap-api/1.3.5/javax.xml.soap-api-1.3.5.jar; rename to javax.xml.soap-api.jar)
     activation.jar  (http://java.sun.com/products/archive/javabeans/jaf11.html)

   You will also need to include the javax.servlet classes in your
   CLASSPATH to compile the servlets.

   The javax.servlet classes are delivered with the Sun Java(tm) System 
   Application Server, and the Sun Java(tm) System Web Server in the
   following locations -

     Application Server - <INSTALL_ROOT>/lib/j2ee-ext.jar
     Web Server - <INSTALL_ROOT>/bin/https/jar/servlet.jar

To run the examples, you will only need <IMQ_HOME>/lib/imqxm.jar
in your CLASSPATH.


========================================
3. Assembling and deploying the servlets
========================================

This section outlines the procedures for assembling and deploying the sample
servlets to the Sun Java(tm) System Application Server (version 7.0 and later) 
and the Sun Java(tm) System Web Server (version 6.0 and later).
You can adapt these procedures to any server that supports a
J2EE1.3 Web Container.


1.  Make the <IMQ_HOME>/examples/jaxm directory your current directory.


2.  Ensure that all the examples have been compiled as in the previous section.


3.  Create a directory called WEB-INF/classes.


4.  Copy the SOAPEchoServlet class file to the WEB-INF/classes directory. 


5.  Create a file named web.xml in the WEB-INF directory. 

    The contents of the file should be as follows:


        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        <web-app version="2.4" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee
            http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd">

        <!-- Define servlet-mapped and path-mapped example filters -->

        <!-- Define servlets that are included in the example application -->

        <servlet>
            <servlet-name>SOAPEchoServlet</servlet-name>
            <servlet-class>SOAPEchoServlet</servlet-class>
        </servlet>

        <servlet-mapping>
            <servlet-name>SOAPEchoServlet</servlet-name>
            <url-pattern>/imqSOAPexamples/SOAPEchoServlet</url-pattern>
        </servlet-mapping>

        </web-app>



6.  Create the war file by running the following command:

    % jar -cvf imqSOAPexamples.war WEB-INF 

    The structure of the output file, imqSOAPexamples.war, looks like this: 

      WEB-INF 
         |
         |
       --|---------------
       |                |
    classes          web.xml
       |
    SOAPEchoServlet.class
     

7.  Start the Application Server server using the following command:

    % asadmin start-domain

    which is located in <INSTALL_ROOT>/bin


8.  To deploy the imqSOAPexamples.war file to the Sun Java(tm) System Application 
    Server use the asadmin deploy command.
    Check with the Application Server documentation for the complete syntax.
    Only options whose arguments are given below are listed.

    % asadmin deploy [--type application|ejb|web|connector] [--contextroot \
        contextroot] [--name component-name] [...other options...] filepath

    In this instance, specify - 
    "web" for the type-application argument,
    "imqExamples" for the contextroot and name arguments, and
    the location of the war file for the filepath argument
        which for these instructions is <IMQ_ROOT>/examples/jaxm/imqSOAPexamples.war
    


==========================================
4. Running the example client applications
==========================================


The servlet examples  - SOAPEchoServlet and SOAPtoJMSServlet - are described below.


  - SOAPEchoServlet.java

    The SOAPEchoServlet.java example uses the javax.xml.messaging.JAXMServlet
    class to implement a servlet that receives a SOAP messages and echoes a
    SOAP message back as an acknowledgement.


  - SOAPtoJMSServlet.java

    The SOAPtoJMSServlet.java example uses the javax.xml.messaging.JAXMServlet
    class to implement a servlet that receives a SOAP message and sends the
    SOAP message using JMS.
    The onMessage() method of the servlet uses the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message 
    Queue Message Transformer facility to convert the SOAP message to a JMS message,
    and then uses JMS to 'publish' the JMS message to a JMS Topic.
    The default topic name used is "TestTopic". This can be changed via the
    servlet init parameter called "TopicName".
    The onMessage() method also adds a message status element with the
    value "published" to the SOAPBody and returns the SOAP message to the caller.


The JAXM client example - SendSOAPMessage is described below.

  - SendSOAPMessage.java

    The SendSOAPMessage.jave example uses the JAXM API to send a
    "hello world" SOAP message to a SOAP endpoint.
    The sendMessage method (called from main) uses JAXM to construct a
    SOAP message object and an endpoint object, and then send the SOAP message
    to that endpoint.


    To exercise either servlet deployed in the previous section run the
    SendSOAPMessage example using the following command:


    % java SendSOAPMessage <soap_servlet_url>

      where <soap_servlet_url> is the url at which a SOAP endpoint/servlet
      has been deployed.

      e.g.

      % java SendSOAPMessage http://<host>:<port>/<contextroot>/<servletname>

    This command runs the SendSOAPMessage program, passing in (command line)
    the parameter that specifies the url of the soap servlet.
    You need to specify values for the host, port, and contextroot arguments.
    You also need to specify the name of the servlet you want to run:
        either SOAPEchoServlet or SOAPtoJMSServlet in <servletname>.


    Output on the screen for the SOAPEchoServlet should look like this: 

    <soap-env:Envelope xmlns: soap-env="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><soap-env:Header/> 
    <soap-env:Body><HelloWorld>Welcome to SunOne Web Services!</HelloWorld></soap-env:Body> 
    </soap-env:Envelope> 

    NOTE: You can also send the SOAP message to an HTTPS URL.
          You will need to refer to the server documentation for
          information on how to deploy the servlet at an https URL.


The next two examples demonstrate how to use SOAP messages with JMS clients.

  - SendSOAPMessageWithJMS.java

    The SendSOAPMessageWithJMS example uses the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue 
    MessageTransformer to send SOAP messages to a JMS Topic.
    In this example, a SOAP message is first constructed using the
    javax.xml.soap package.
    Next, content acquired from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-137004.html
    is added to the SOAP message.
    The SOAP message is then converted to a JMS message using the
    MessageTransformer utility.
    Finally, the JMS message is published to a JMS topic.

    To run this program, use the following command:

    % java SendSOAPMessageWithJMS <topic_name>

    If you do not specify a topic_name argument, the default value
    of "TestTopic" will be used.

    NOTE: If your environment requires routing internet HTTP requests
          via a proxy, be sure to specify HTTP proxy settings using
          the -D command line options as shown below.
          The Java platform properties that need to be set are -
              http.proxyHost <defaults to None>
              http.proxyPort <defaults to 80 if http.proxyHost is specified>

    % java -D"http.ProxyHost=proxy_server_name" SendSOAPMessageWithJMS <topic_name>


  - ReceiveSOAPMessageWithJMS.java

    The ReceiveSOAPMessageWithJMS example, a JMS message listener receives
    a JMS message (containing a SOAP message). The listener uses the
    MessageTransformer to convert JMS messages back to a SOAP message.

    To run this program, use the following command

    % java ReceiveSOAPMessageWithJMS <topic_name>

    If you do not specify a topic_name argument, the default value
    of "TestTopic" will be used.
    This example can be used to receive messages sent with either the
    SendSOAPMessageWithJMS example client or the SOAPtoJMSServlet example
    servlet.
