HelloWorldMessageJNDI example

Description
-----------
This example demonstrates a simple end-to-end "Hello World" JMS example that 
can be compiled and run with the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue 
product. The test program uses Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to 
lookup administered objects, sends and receives a JMS "Hello World" message via 
a Queue destination.

This example is also the companion example used in the "Administration Console 
Tutorial" (Chapter 4 of the MQ Administrator's Guide). The "Administration 
Console Tutorial" focuses more on the Administration Console GUI; this README
contains instructions that use the command line tool imqobjmgr.

This example demonstrates the following:
 - How to create and store MQ administered objects in a file based object 
   store using the MQ imqobjmgr tool.
 - A simple "Hello World" JMS Application:
     - How to use the JNDI APIs to lookup MQ administered objects in a file 
       based object store.
     - Sending and receiving JMS messages.
     - How to compile the JMS application.
     - How to run the JMS application.

JMS/MQ background
-----------------
Every JMS application that sends and/or receives messages needs access to at 
least 2 JMS administered objects:

    Connection Factory object
    Destination object

The Connection Factory object is used by the application to connect to the JMS
provider (MQ broker). The Destination object is used to identify the relevant
destination on the JMS provider, for example when sending or receiving messages.
Each JMS provider (like MQ) has it's own implementation of the above objects 
which encapsulate provider-specific implementation and configuration 
information.

This example uses the Queue messaging domain which means that the specific 
object types the example will deal with are:

    Connection Factory object (jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory)
    Queue Destination object (jakarta.jms.Queue)

The above 2 objects can be directly instantiated by the JMS application. For
example:

    cf = new com.sun.messaging.ConnectionFactory();

    (com.sun.messaging.ConnectionFactory is an object that is of type
      jakarta.jms.ConnectionFactory)
	
However, this makes the application not portable across JMS vendors. To make 
a JMS application truly portable, the objects should be stored in an object 
store and JNDI should be used to look them up. The fact that the objects used 
here are MQ specific will be completely transparent to the application if JNDI
is used. These objects can also be shared by multiple applications that need
access to the same MQ brokers and destinations. 

Having all the JMS applications use administered objects in one object store 
also makes management a little easier - compare this to the case where every JMS 
application each instantiated it's own administered objects; managing which MQ 
broker or destination each application uses can become difficult as the 
complexity and size of the application grows.

MQ provides the object manager utility/tool (imqobjmgr) to manage (add, delete, 
list, query, or update) MQ administered objects in an object store. To create 
an administered object, imqobjmgr accepts the following information:
 - The command/action that is needed: add
 - The type of object in question e.g. Topic, Queue, Connection Factory,
   etc.
 - Attributes/properties of the object.
 - Location of object store. This is specified as JNDI properties.
 - JNDI lookupname of object in object store

Details on how the above information is specified to imqobjmgr is explained in
the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue Administrator's Guide. It can also 
be seen as part of imqobjmgr usage help:

    imqobjmgr -H

To ease the running of this example, imqobjmgr command files will be used. 
imqobjmgr allows you to specify the name of a command file that uses java 
property file syntax to represent all or part of the imqobjmgr subcommand 
clause. Using a command file with imqobjmgr is especially useful to specify 
object store attributes, which are likely to be the same across multiple 
invocations of imqobjmgr and which normally require a lot of typing. Command
files can help reduce errors caused by typos on the command line. Using a 
command file can also allow you to avoid a situation in which you might 
otherwise exceed the maximum number of characters allowed for the command line. 
So instead of typing:

    imqobjmgr add
       -t q 
       -l "MyQueue" 
       -o "imqDestinationName=MyQueueDest" 
       -j java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
       -j java.naming.provider.url=file:///C:/Temp

(all on one line)

you only need to type:

    imqobjmgr -i add_q.props

(where add_q.props is a command file)

Each command file that is a part of this example will contain sufficient 
documentation to show what the full imqobjmgr command line is required to 
perform the equivalent action.

The format or syntax of the imqobjmgr command/input file is described in
the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue Administrator's Guide.

Specifying the object Store: JNDI Properties
--------------------------------------------
The imqobjmgr tool uses JNDI to manage the object store. The object store 
is specified to imqobjmgr via various JNDI properties. The most commonly 
used JNDI properties here are:

    - java.naming.factory.initial (Initial Context Factory)
      The initial context factory is used to specify which JNDI service 
      provider you wish to use for your object store; for example, the 
      file system, LDAP or some other JNDI service provider.

      The value to use for a file system object store is:
        com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory
      The value to use for an LDAP based object store is:
        com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory

    - java.naming.provider.url (Provider URL)
      This is the property for specifying the URL or location of
      your object store. The provider URL value is dependent on what
      service provider was specified for java.naming.factory.initial.
      For a file system object store, an example value for this is:
	file:///C:/Temp
      or
	file:///tmp

      The directory specified for a file system object store must
      already exist and must be accessible by the application or
      tool using it.

      For an LDAP based object store, an example value for this is:
	ldap://myldaphost:389/ou=mqobjs, o=myapplication


Configuring the environment
---------------------------
To recompile or run this example, you need to set CLASSPATH
to include at least:
    jms.jar
    imq.jar
    fscontext.jar
    directory containing this example

A detailed guideline on configuring your enrivonment and setting CLASSPATH 
is found in the top-level README file of the examples (demo) directory of
the Message Queue installation (<IMQ_HOME>/examples/README) as well as in
the "Quick Start Tutorial" in the Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue 
Developer's Guide.

Building the example
--------------------
Run the following:

    javac HelloWorldMessageJNDI.java

Running the example
-------------------
Here are the steps for running this example:
1. Verify object store file location.
2. Create the Connection Factory administered object.
3. Create the Queue administered object.
4. Start the MQ broker.
5. Run the JMS application.
6. Cleanup


1. Verify object store file location
------------------------------------
This example uses the file system object store. The directory that
is used by default is C:/Temp. This is a path that is commonly
available on the Windows platform. This path is used as the value
for the JNDI provider URL for the object store. The provider URL
that is specified has the following syntax:

    file:///C:/Temp

If this path is not available for use (for example, if you are running 
on a Solaris machine), you need to:
 - Modify the value of the objstore.attrs.java.naming.provider.url
   property in all the imqobjmgr command files (*.props). They already
   have a commented out entry that specifies the /tmp directory on 
   Solaris as an example of how to configure this property differently.
 - (This is to be done later) Run the sample application with the new 
   provider URL for example:

    java HelloWorldMessageJNDI file:///tmp

2. Create the Connection Factory administered object
----------------------------------------------------------
To create the connection factory object, run the following:

    imqobjmgr -i add_cf.props

3. Create the Queue administered object
---------------------------------------
To create the queue object, run the following:

    imqobjmgr -i add_q.props

Optional: 
After creating the Connection Factory and Queue objects,
you can verify that they exist by listing them:

    imqobjmgr -i list.props

4. Start the broker
-------------------
The command for starting the broker is:

   imqbrokerd

Run the above command in a separate command (or terminal) window.

5. Run the JMS application
--------------------------
To run the sample application, run the following command:

    java HelloWorldMessageJNDI

or 

    java HelloWorldMessageJNDI file:///tmp

if you need to specify an alternate provider URL (object store location). 
As noted above, the default is file:///C:/Temp

You should see the following output:

    Using file:///C:/Temp for Context.PROVIDER_URL

    Looking up Connection Factory object with lookup 
	name: MyConnectionFactory
    Connection Factory object found.

    Looking up Queue object with lookup name: MyQueue
    Queue object found.

    Creating connection to broker.
    Connection to broker created.

    Publishing a message to Queue: MyQueueDest
    Received the following message: Hello World

6. Cleanup
----------
Once you are done with the example, you can optionally delete the administered
objects created by running:
    imqobjmgr -i delete_cf.props
    imqobjmgr -i delete_q.props

You will be prompted for confirmation - respond with 'y'.
